# Sunil Kumar v. Ram Parkash (1988) 2 SCC 77

Judge: Ray, Jagannatha Shetty

## Facts

* On February 1978, Ram Parkash entered into an agreement for sale of certain house property in favour of Jai Bhagwan. Property was described as self acquired property of Ram Prakash.

* Later, Ram Prakash did not execute the sale deed though called upon to do so.

* Jai Bhagwan instituted a suit for specific performance of the agreement.

* In that suit, Rakesh Kumar and his brothers who are the sons of Ram Parkash wanted to be impleaded as parties to the suit. They wanted to resist the suit for specific performance. But, court did not permit them on the grounds of being unnecessary parties to the suit.

* Being unsuccessful in that, they instituted a suit for permanent injunction against father.

* Their case was that the said house was their coparcenary property and the proposed sale was neither for legal necessity nor for the benefit of the joint family estate.

* Trial court findings: 

   1. Property was coparcenary property

   2. Jai Bhagwan failed to prove that:

   a. the proposed sale was for legal necessity of the joint family.

   b. the intended sale was for benefit of the estate.

   3. Manager of the family cannot alienate coparcenary property in the absence of those two requirements.

   4. The sons could restrain their father from alienating the coparcenary property since the proposed sale was without justification.

* Jai Bhagwan died during the pendency of the suit. His wife and children challenged trial court’s decision before the ADJ, Kurukshetra. By then, Punjab and Haryana HC had declared in Jujhar Singh v. GianiTalokSingh that suit for injunction to restrain karta from alienating coparcenary property is not maintainable.

* ADJ followed this decision of the HC and reversed the decision of the trial court. 

* Plaintiff then approached the HC but got no relief. 

* Then, by way of special leave, they appealed to the Supreme Court.

## Issue

Whether a suit for permanent injunction restraining the karta of the joint Hindu family from alienating the house property belonging to the joint Hindu family in pursuance of the agreement to sell executed already in favour of the predecessor of the appellants, Jai Bhagwan, since deceased, is maintainable?

## Observations of the Court and Decision

### Regarding Joint Hindu Family 

* Consists of male members descended lineally from a common male ancestor, together with their mothers, wives or widows and unmarried daughters.

* They are bound together by the fundamental principle of sapindaship or family relationship which is the essential feature of the institution.

* The cord that knits the members of the family is not property but the relationship of one another.

### Regarding Coparcenary

* Consists of only those persons who have taken by birth an interest in the property of the holder and who can enforce a partition whenever they like.

* Narrower body within the Joint Hindu Family.

* Commences with a common ancestor and extends upto 4 generations below him, including him.

* Reason for this limit is that in Hindu religion, only male descendants up to three degrees can offer spiritual ministration to an ancestor.

### Regarding Joint Family Property

* Sudarsanam Maistri v. Narasimhulu Maistri ((1902) ILR 25 Mad 149) held that there are 2 requisites for JFP to exist:

1.	There should be a family unit (a corporate body).

2.	That family unit should be in possession of that property. 

   so long as family is in undivided state, it forms a corporate body. Such corporate body is purely a creature of law and not the act of parties.

### Regarding Unobstructed Heritage

To be edited. 

### Regarding Managing Member and his Powers 

* unique position: 

   1. occupies a position superior to other members, 

   2. greater rights and duties

   3. entitled to possession of the entire joint estate

   4. entitled to manage the family properties

   5. actual possession and management of the joint family property must vest in him.

   6. may consult the members of the family and if necessary take their consent to his action but he is not answerable to every one of them.

   7. has not only the power to manage but also power to alienate joint family property.

* Manager’s legal position: relation between him and the other members of the family is not that of principal and agent, or of partners. It is more like that of a trustee and cestui que trust. But, it does not involve all the duties which are imposed upon trustees. 

* Powers w.r.t. alienation: 

   1. Has power to alienate JFP.

   2. Can do so either for family necessity

   3. Or for the benefit of the estate.

   4. Such alienation would bind the interests of all the undivided members of the family whether they are adults or minors.

   5. Principles laid down in [Hunooman persaud v. Babooee](https://technolawhere.github.io/posts/Hunooman-Prasad-Panday-Vs.-Mussumat-Babooee-Munraj-Koonweree-(1854-57)/) apply equally to a father or other coparcener who manages the joint family estate.

### Remedies against Alienations

* Members of the family have a right to have the transaction declared void, if not justified

* When alienation is challenged, it would be for the alienee to prove that there was a legal necessity in fact or that he made proper and bona fide enquiry as to the existence of such necessity. (As decided in [Hunooman persaud v. Babooee](https://technolawhere.github.io/posts/Hunooman-Prasad-Panday-Vs.-Mussumat-Babooee-Munraj-Koonweree-(1854-57)/))

* Such alienations would be void except to the extent of Manager’s share in Madras, Bombay and Central Provinces. The purchaser could get only the Manager’s share. But in other provinces, the purchaser would not get even that much. The entire alienation would be void.

* coparcener not entitled to separate possession of the coparcenary estate, his rights are not independent of the control of the karta. 

* It would be for the karta to consider the actual pressure on the joint family estate, to foresee the danger to be averted, to examine as to how best the joint family estate could be beneficially put into use to subserve the interests of the family. Father-karta has special power to sell or mortgage ancestral property to discharge his antecedent debt which is not tainted with immorality. Coparcener cannot interfere in these acts of management.

* If no such need or benefit, the purchaser takes risk and the right and interest of coparcener will remain unimpaired in the alienated property.

* However, law confers a right on the coparcener to challenge the alienation, but that right is not inclusive of the right to obstruct alienation:

   *Right to challenge alienation: right to claim a share in the joint family estate free from unnecessary and unwanted encumbrance.

   * Right to obstruct alienation: right to interfere with the act of management of the joint family affairs.

   Thus, a coparcener cannot move the court to grant relief by injunction restraining the karta from alienating the coparcenery property.

### Regarding Perpetual Injunction

* Temporary injunction: can be granted under sub-section (1) of Section 37 Specific Relief Act, 1963 (regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908). 

* Decree for perpetual injunction is made under sub-section (2) of Section 37. Grant of Perpetual injunction u/s 38 of Special Relief Act.

* Section 41 provides that an injunction cannot be granted in the cases falling under clauses (a) to (j) and clause h reads that injunction cannot be granted when a party could obtain an efficacious relief by any other usual mode of proceeding (except in case of breach of trust).

* Since coparceners have adequate remedies to impeach the alienation by karta, that cannot move the court for an injunction due to the above provisions of law. 

* Moreover, if such a suit for injunction is held maintainable the effect will be that whenever the father as karta of the joint Hindu coparcenary property will propose to sell such property owing to a bona fide legal necessity, any coparcener may come up with such a suit for permanent injunction and the father will not be able to sell the property for legal necessity until and unless that suit is decided. This would defeat the purpose for which special powers have been given to the karta w.r.t. alienation. 

* Decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Jujhar Singh v. Giani Talok Singh, which overturned the judgment in Shiv Kumar Mool Chand Arora v. Mool Chand Jaswant Ram Arora was upheld:

   * “Legally speaking unless the alienation in fact is completed there would be no cause of action for any coparcener to maintain a suit because the right is only to challenge the alienation made”

   * “coparcener has no right to maintain a suit for permanent injunction restraining the manager or the karta from alienating the coparcenary property and his right is only to challenge the same and to recover the property after it has come into being.”
