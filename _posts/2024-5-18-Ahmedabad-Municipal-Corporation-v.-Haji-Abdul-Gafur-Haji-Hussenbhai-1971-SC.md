# Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation v. Haji Abdul Gafur Haji Hussenbhai, AIR 1971 SC 1201 ; (1971) 1 SCC 757

Judge: DUA

## Facts

* The property of an adjudged insolvent became vested with an Official Receiver appointed by the court.

* Receiver received a bill pertaining to taxes due from the Municipality, in response to which he approached the Court to sell the property for making the required payment.

* However, for 5 years, nothing was done by the Receiver or the Municipality.

* Thereafter a purchaser purchased it without being told of the municipal charge even after making inquiries.

* It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the doctrine of caveat emptor applies and that the purchaser of the property was liable as he had constructive notice of the municipal charge.

## Issue

* Whether a person can be said to have a constructive notice in cases involving past arrears of municipal taxes.

## Observations and Decision of the Court

* Question of determining a constructive notice is dependent on the **facts and circumstances** of each case. There is no presumption of constructive notice regarding municipal taxes.

* The decision of **Naval Kishore v. Municipal Board of Agra 1943 ALJ 53**, in which it was held that all intending purchasers of properties lying in municipal areas have a duty to enquire about the amount of tax due and failure to do so would lead to the imputation of a constructive notice against them, was overruled.

* Decision of **Municipal Board, Cawnpore v. Roop Chand Jain (AIR 1940 All 456)**, wherein it was held that no intending purchaser is bound to presume that taxes on a property were in arrears unless there is something to show otherwise like special intimation by the municipality by say a notification in press, was upheld.

* Court said that the question of wilful abstention or gross negligence and constructive notice is generally a question of fact or at best mixed question of fact and law depending primarily on the facts and circumstances of each case and except for cases directly falling within the three explanations, **no inflexible rule can be laid down to serve as a straight-jacket** covering all possible contingencies.

* Further it was said that the question one has to answer is not whether the purchaser had the means of obtaining and might with prudent
caution have obtained knowledge of the charge but whether in not doing so he acted with **wilful abstention or gross negligence**. This question depends on the behaviour of a reasonably prudent man and the Courts must be cautious in deciding and give heed to the background of Indian conditions before seeking assistance from English precedents.

* Finally, the Court said that the Question has to be approached from equitable considerations and held the Municipality to be far more negligent and blameworthy than the respondent.

* Decision of the HC was upheld.
