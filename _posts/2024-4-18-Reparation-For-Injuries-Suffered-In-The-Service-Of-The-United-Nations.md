# Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the Service of The United Nations (I.C. J. Reports 1949, p. 174)

## Statutes/Charters/Conventions and Sections/Articles Involved from therein:
1. **Article 1 Charter of the United Nations, 1945**

   The **Purposes** of the United Nations are:
   1.	To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace;
     
   3. To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;
      
   5. To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and
     
   7. To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.

   1. The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members
      
   3. All Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter.
      
   4. All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.

5. **Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the U.N. of 1946**

## Facts:
* Following the death of 2 of its agents in the line of duty, the General Assembly of the UN passed a resolution to submit the following questions before the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion:
  
   “In the event of an agent of the United Nations in the performance of his duties suffering injury in circumstances involving the responsibility of a State, has the United Nations, as an Organization, the capacity to bring an international claim against the responsible de jure or de facto government with a view to obtaining the reparation due in respect of the damage caused (a) to the United Nations, (b) to the victim or to persons entitled through him?
  
  In the event of an affirmative reply on point 1 (b), how is action by the United Nations to be reconciled with such rights as may be possessed by the State of which the victim is a national?”

## Issues, Observations and Opinions:

### Does the Organization possess international personality or that personality that allows it to avail of obligations incumbent on its members?
* Isn’t explicitly stated in the charter. Thus, it needs to be seen if it’s provided for, implicitly, by considering what characteristics the charter intended to give the organization.
  
* UN has certain purposes (Article 1) and principles (Article 2), that have been specified in its Charter and those ends cannot be achieved without an international personality.
  
* Charged with important political tasks like:
  
   * maintenance of international peace and security
     
   * development of friendly relation among nation
     
   * achievement of international co-operation in the solution of problem of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character
     
* Rights and duties of the UN vis-à-vis its members are given under Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the U.N. of 1946. For the operation of this convention, all parties necessarily need to possess an international personality.
  
* From the above, it’s clear that the members of the UN have given it an international personality, that is required to competently discharge its functions, duties and responsibilities.
  
* Thus, the court came to the conclusion that UN is an international person, which is to say it is a subject of international law.

### Does declaring UN as an international person put it at par with the States in the international domain?

* No.
  
* Its legal right and duties are not the same as that of the state either.
  
* Its not to be considered as a “Super-State”.
  
* “International person” means declaring it as a subject of international law and is capable of possessing international rights, duties and has the capacity to bring international claims to enforce its rights.

### Do International Organizations have the capacity to bring an international claim?

* Since the functions of the Org. are of such character that they cannot be effectively discharged if they involved the concurrent action of all its members, the court concluded that the members have endowed the Organization with capacity to bring international claims when necessitated by the discharge of its functions.

* In the present case, as the interests of the Organization were damaged by a member by breaching its international obligations towards the Org., the Org. is entitled to bring claims against that member. 

### Can UN recover "the reparation due in respect of the damage caused....to the victim...."?

* The traditional rule that diplomatic protection is exercised by the national State cannot be used to alienate the Organization from its right to bring an international claim as:
   
   * this rule applies to claims brought by a State.
   
   * even in inter-State relations, there are important exceptions. For eg. protection may be exercised by a State on behalf of persons not having its nationality
   
   * Moreover, this rule is founded on the principle that only those states to whom international obligations are due, can bring a claim. This is precisely what has happened here. There was a breach of obligation towards the org. and this entitles it to bring a claim.

Thus, this rule in fact leads to the recognition of this capacity as belonging to the Organization, when the Organization invokes, as the ground of its claim, a breach of an obligation towards itself.

* The line of work of the agents of such international organizations, more often than not, involve dangerous tasks and its essential that they should not have to rely on protection other than that of the Org. they are working for.

* In particular, he should not have to rely on the protection of his own State. If he had to rely on that State, his independence might be compromised, contrary to the principle applied by Article 100 of the Charter.

* Obligations entered into by States to enable the agents of the Organization to perform their duties, are undertaken not in the interest of the agents, but in that of the Organization. Thus, when claims are made by the organization, they are made invoking its own right.

* On this ground, it asks for reparation of the injury suffered, for "it is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form"; as was stated by the Permanent Court in its Judgment No. 8 of July 26th, 1927 (Series A, No. 9, p. 21).

* In claiming reparation based on the injury suffered by its agent, the Organization does not represent the agent, but is asserting its own right, the right to secure respect for undertakings entered into towards the Organization.

* Thus, in the case of a breach of these obligations, the Organization has the capacity to claim adequate reparation, and that in assessing this reparation it is authorized to include the damage suffered by the victim or by persons entitled through him.

### Whether the Organization has the capacity to bring claims against non-member States?

* Fifty States, representing the vast majority of the members of the international community, had the power, in conformity with international law, to bring into being an entity possessing objective international personality, and not merely personality recognized by them alone, together with capacity to bring international claims.

* Thus, such a claim can be brought against both a member state as well as a non-member state.

### "In the event of an affirmative reply on point 1 (b)…” (ability to claim, by the UN, reparations due to the victims) ”…, how is action by the United Nations to be reconciled with such rights as may be possessed by the State of which the victim is a national?"

* In such a case, there is no rule of law which assigns priority to one or to the other, or which compels either the State or the Organization to refrain from bringing an international claim.

* Question of reconciling action by the Organization with the rights of a national State may arise in another way; that is to say, when the agent bears the nationality of the defendant State.

* The action of the Organization is in fact based not upon the nationality of the victim but upon his status as agent of the Organization.

* Thus, it does not seem that the fact of the possession of the nationality of the defendant State by the agent constitutes any obstacle to a claim brought by the Organization for a breach of obligations towards it.

## Other Observations:

* Subjects of law in any legal system are not necessarily identical in their nature or in the extent of their rights, and their nature depends upon the needs of the community.

* Who is a Subject of international law?

  * Should be capable of possessing international rights,
    
  * Should be capable of possessing international duties, and
    
  * Has the capacity to bring international claims to enforce its rights.
