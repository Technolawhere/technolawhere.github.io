# Arshnoor Singh v. Harpal Kaur Decided on 1 July, 2019 (SC) CIVIL APPEAL NO.5124 OF 2019

Judge: Indu Malhotra, J.

## Facts

* Large tracts of agricultural land were inherited by the only son Inder Singh, from his father Lal Singh when he passed away in 1951.

* Inder Singh during his lifetime, effected a partition of the entire property between his three sons: Gurcharan Singh, Dharam Singh, and Swaran Singh in equal shares. Thereafter, the three sons transferred onefourth share in the entire property back to their father Inder Singh for his sustenance. As a consequence, Inder Singh and his three sons held onefourth share each in the property. 

* Inder Singh expired in 1970, and his one fourth share was inherited by his heirs i.e. his widow, three sons, and his daughter.

* Present matter pertains to the property which came to the share of one of his sons viz. Dharam Singh.

* Dharam Singh had only one son viz. Arshnoor Singh – the Appellant herein.  who was born to him in 1985 through his first wife.

* Dharam Singh in 1999 executed Sale Deeds to tranfer the property to Respondent No.1 (Harpal Kaur) without any monetary consideration as Respondent No.1 insisted on transfer of the suit property in her name as a pre condition for marriage.

* The Appellant became a major in 2003. On 23.11.2004, the Appellant filed a Suit for Declaration of the property as coparcenary property in order to get the sale deeds to Harpal Kaur illegal, null and void. He further prayed for a permanent injunction  restraining Respondent No.1 from further alienating, transferring, or creating a charge on the suit property.

* Additional Civil Judge decreed the Suit in favour of the Appellant/Plaintiff. Property was held to be coparcenary property and as no legal necessity or benefit of estate was proved, the sale deeds were held to be null and void.

* Decision appealed before the Addl. District Judge. Civil Judge's Decision was upheld.

* Decision then appealed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. During pendancy, Dharam Singh expired on 05.01.2017.

* HC held that:
  
   * Appellant had no locus to institute the Suit, since the coparcenary property ceased to exist after Inder Singh partitioned the property between his 3 sons in 1964
     
   * The Appellant had no right to challenge the Sale Deeds on the ground that the sale consideration had not been paid, since only the executant of the Sale Deeds viz. Dharam Singh (Defendant No. 1) could have made such a challenge
 
   * Jamabandis for the years 1957 – 58 till 1970 – 71 were not produced by the Appellant
 
## Issues 

1. Whether the suit property was coparcenary property or selfacquired property of Dharam Singh

2. Whether the sale deeds executed by Dharam Singh and then by HArpal Kaur valid?
