# Arshnoor Singh v. Harpal Kaur Decided on 1 July, 2019 (SC) CIVIL APPEAL NO.5124 OF 2019

Judge: Indu Malhotra, J.

## Facts

* Large tracts of agricultural land were inherited by the only son Inder Singh, from his father Lal Singh when he passed away in 1951.

* Inder Singh during his lifetime, effected a partition of the entire property between his three sons: Gurcharan Singh, Dharam Singh, and Swaran Singh in equal shares. Thereafter, the three sons transferred onefourth share in the entire property back to their father Inder Singh for his sustenance. As a consequence, Inder Singh and his three sons held onefourth share each in the property. 

* Inder Singh expired in 1970, and his one fourth share was inherited by his heirs i.e. his widow, three sons, and his daughter.

* Present matter pertains to the property which came to the share of one of his sons viz. Dharam Singh.

* Dharam Singh had only one son viz. Arshnoor Singh – the Appellant herein.  who was born to him in 1985 through his first wife.

* Dharam Singh in 1999 executed Sale Deeds to tranfer the property to Respondent No.1 (Harpal Kaur) without any monetary consideration as Respondent No.1 insisted on transfer of the suit property in her name as a pre condition for marriage.

* The Appellant became a major in 2003. On 23.11.2004, the Appellant filed a Suit for Declaration of the property as coparcenary property in order to get the sale deeds to Harpal Kaur illegal, null and void. He further prayed for a permanent injunction  restraining Respondent No.1 from further alienating, transferring, or creating a charge on the suit property.

* Additional Civil Judge decreed the Suit in favour of the Appellant/Plaintiff. Property was held to be coparcenary property and as no legal necessity or benefit of estate was proved, the sale deeds were held to be null and void.

* Decision appealed before the Addl. District Judge. Civil Judge's Decision was upheld.

* Decision then appealed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. During pendancy, Dharam Singh expired on 05.01.2017.

* HC held that:
  
   * Appellant had no locus to institute the Suit, since the coparcenary property ceased to exist after Inder Singh partitioned the property between his 3 sons in 1964
     
   * The Appellant had no right to challenge the Sale Deeds on the ground that the sale consideration had not been paid, since only the executant of the Sale Deeds viz. Dharam Singh (Defendant No. 1) could have made such a challenge
 
   * Jamabandis for the years 1957 – 58 till 1970 – 71 were not produced by the Appellant
 
## Issues 

1. Whether the suit property was coparcenary property or selfacquired property of Dharam Singh

2. Whether the sale deeds executed by Dharam Singh and then by HArpal Kaur valid?

## Observations and Decision 

* If succession opened under the old Hindu law, i.e. prior to the commencement of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the parties would be governed by Mitakshara law. The property inherited by a male Hindu from his paternal male ancestor shall be coparcenary property in his hands visàvis his male descendants upto three degrees below him. The nature of property will remain as coparcenary property even after the commencement of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.

* The succession opened in 1951 on the death of Lal Singh. The nature of the property inherited by his son Inder Singh was coparcenary in nature. Even though Inder Singh had effected a partition of the coparcenary property amongst his sons in 1964, the nature of the property inherited by Inder Singh’s sons would remain as coparcenary property qua their male descendants upto three degrees below them.

* Judgement of Uttam v. Saubhag Singh, (2016) 4 SCC 68 that "On a conjoint reading of Sections 4, 8 and 19 of the Act, after joint family property has been distributed in accordance with section 8 on principles of intestacy, the joint family property ceases to be joint family property in the hands of the various persons who have succeeded to it as they hold the property as tenants in common and not as joint tenants" was held to be non applicable to this case as the succession in that case opened up in 1973, i.e., after the commencement of the act.

* The position of Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Kanpur and Ors. v. Chander Sen and Ors. 1986 that after the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 came into force, if a person inherits a selfacquired property from his paternal ancestors, the said property becomes his self acquired property, and does not remain coparcenary property still remains true. This would not affect the nature of properties whose succession had started before the commencement of the act.

* With regard to the nature of coparcenary property after partition, the court upheld the decision given in Valliammai Achi v. Nagappa Chettiar and Ors., AIR 1967 SC 1153 that the share which a cosharer obtains on partition of ancestral property is ancestral property as regards his male issues. They take an interest in it by birth whether they are in existence at the time of partition or are born subsequently.

* Thus, wrt to the first issue, it was held that the suit property which came to the share of late Dharam Singh through partition, remained coparcenary property qua his son – the Appellant herein, who became a coparcener in the suit property on his birth i.e. on 22.08.1985.Dharam Singh purportedly executed the two Sale Deeds on 01.09.1999 in favour of Respondent No. 1 after the Appellant became a coparcener in the suit property.

* Wrt to the second issue, the court said that there is a restriction of legal necessity or benefit of estate on the powers of the karta to sell the coparcenary property. However the court said the burden to establish the existence of legal necessity or benefit of estate is on the alienee, as was held in Rani &Anr. v. Santa Bala Debnath &Ors., (1970) 3 SCC 722.

* Thus, in the present case, the onus was on the alienee i.e. Respondent No. 1 to prove that there was a legal necessity, or benefit to the estate, or that she had made bona fide enquiries on the existence of the same.

* As Respondent No. 1 has completely failed to discharge the burden of proving that Dharam Singh had executed the two Sale Deeds dated 01.09.1999 in her favour out of legal necessity or for the benefit of the estate (The very fact that the Sale Deeds dated 01.09.1999 were executed without any consideration, would itself show that the suit property was sold without any legal necessity), sale deeds were cancelled by the court. 

* Moreover, since Respondent No. 1 has not obtained a valid and legal title to the suit property through the Sale Deeds, she could not have passed on a better title to Respondent Nos. 2 & 3 either. Thus, subsequent sale deeds were hit by doctrine of lis pendens.
   
   * Note: underlying principle of the doctrine of lis pendens is that if a property is transferred pendente lite, and the transferor is held to have no right or title in that property, the transferee will not have any title to the property

* Decision of HC set aside.
