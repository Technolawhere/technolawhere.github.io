# Padarath Halwai v. Ram Narain, AIR 1915 PC 21

JUDGE: SIR JOHN EDGE

## Facts

Here 2 pardanashin ladies had executed a mortgage, however, the attesting witnesses had not seen them but only heard their voice. 

## Issue

Whether the deed was duly attested by 2 witnesses, who didnt identify the mortgagers by their faces but only hy their voice, within the meaning of S. 59, TPA 1882.

## Observations and Decision

* The court said that as the attesting witnesses, who were familiar with the voices of the two ladies, identified them by thier voices before seeing them execute the deed by their own hands, and then attested the document, the attestation would be valid even though they did not see their faces.

* Thus, what is important is the identification of the executants by the attesting witnesses and witnessing the execution of the deed or the recieving personal acknowledgement of such execution from the executants themselves.
