# Bamadev Panigrahi v. Monorama Raj, AIR 1974 AP 226

## Facts

* the plaintiff mortgaged a piece of land from the Raja of Mandasa with a view to run touring cinema in that place.

* For the purpose of this cinema, a temporary cinema structure was built and a temporary pandal was erected. Further a cinema projector and its accessories along with a diesel oil engine accompanied with accessories was purchased.

* The cinema projector and the oil engine and its accessories were embedded and installed in the earth by constructing foundations for the purpose of running the cinema.

* The trial court, on a consideration of the material on record, had found that the cinema equipment as well as the oil engine which were embedded in the earth are immovable property and therefore the suit was within the period of limitation.

## Issues

* Whether a movable property becomes an immovable property on being attached to or fastened to the earth.

## Observations of the Court and Decision

* To determine the nature of the property in question the **inquiry should not be whether the attachment is direct or indirect**, but what is the:
  
   * Nature
     
   * Character
     
   * Intendment
     
   * Object of such attachment
     
* English law of fixtures has no strict application to the law in India relating to machinery
attached to the earth or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth.

* English courts have evolved certain guidelines to determine the nature of machinery:
  
   * In **Holland v. Hodgson (1872) 7 CP 328**, the Court said that **the degree of annexation** and **the object of the annexation** needs to be considered while deciding such questions. Application of general maxim that what is annexed to the land becomes part of the land is very difficult to apply and does not yield precise results always.
 
   * Leigh v. Taylor (1902) AC 157, 161, the court observed that the following things need to be considered in order to determine whether a movable property like tapestries have become a part of the house (immovable property):
     
      * Fashion of times
        
      * Mode of ornamentation
    
      * Degree of attachment
    
* These guidelines have been accepted and used by Indian Courts while determining the nature of machinery in:

   * Narayana Sa v. Balaguruswami AIR 1924 Mad 187
 
   * Meghraj v. Krishna Chandra AIR 1924 All 365
 
   * In **Subrahmaniam Firm v. Chindambaram, AIR 1940 Mad 527**, while determining whether the machinery installed by a tenant for running a cinema taken on lease by him was movable or not, **Judge Wadsworth** observed that
     
      * A thing embedded in the earth will be **considered immovable** if it’s embedded for permanent beneficial enjoyment of that to which it is attached.
    
      * Will be **considered movable** if it is merely attached for the beneficial enjoyment of the chattel itself, even though fixed for the time being so that it may be enjoyed.
    
      * It is essentially a question of facts.
     
* In **Mohammed Ibrahim v. Northern Circars Fibre
Trading Co. Coconada AIR 1944 Mad 492**, the court reasoned that as the machinery was owned and installed by the owner of the building himself, it was immovable property. But, Where the machinery owned by one person was attached to the land belonging to another, it was held by a Division Bench of the Nagpur High Court in **J.H. Subbiah v. Govind Rao AIR 1953 Nag 224** that the machinery is movable property. However, if it was found that the property was fixed for the beneficial use of the immovable property to which it was attached, it was declared to be immovable property (**Chetty & Co. v. Collector of Anantapur AIR 1965 AP 457**)

* In **Board of Revenue v. Venkataswami Naidu AIR 1955 Mad 620**, a Full Bench of the Madras
High Court held that equipment of the touring cinema which is capable of being removed and collapsible does not fall within the category of immovable property.

* The court summarised the above decisions as below:

   * Mixed **question of fact and law**
     
   * **No statutory test** or guideline having universal application
 
   * Cumulative effect or the **totality of the material facts and circumstances** must be taken as a fair and reasonable guide to determine the nature of the property
 
   * English law of fixtures has no strict application to this aspect of the law, in view of the statutory definitions of the expressions ‘immovable property’ and ‘movable property’ in the **[General Clauses Act, Transfer of Property Act and Registration Act](https://pranavsaksena.com/posts/Property-Law/#immovable-property)**.
 
   * **Summary of tests** that can be used to answer such issues are:
 
     1. What is the intendment, object and purpose of installing the machinery – Whether it
is the beneficial enjoyment of the building, land or structure, or the enjoyment of the very machinery?

        * APPLICATION TO THE PRESENT CASE: Object was to run a temporary cinema. Name " Touring Talkies" reflects the same. It, along all the auxiliaries, will be moved freely from place depending upon the demand and the convenience of the proprietor. The lessee or the usufructuary mortgage of the land, in installing the diesel oil engine, cinema projector etc., must invariably have intended to make use of the said equipment during the limited lease period and thereafter, separate the same from the land, as he was not interested in the improvement of the land belonging to another
 
        * The intendment, object and purpose of installing the cinema equipment in question, was only to have the beneficial enjoyment of the very equipment during the period of the lease or mortgage.
    
     3. The degree and manner of attachment or annexation of the machinery to the earth.
    
        * Diesel oil engine and the cinema projector are not rooted in the earth as in the case of trees and shrubs, or imbedded in the earth as in the case of walls or buildings or attached to what is so imbedded for the permanent beneficial enjoyment of that to which they are attached.
    
     5. Whether owner of the building installed the said machinery or not?
        
        * If installed by the owner, it is normally inferred unless contrary is proved that the installation was for the beneficial enjoyment of the entire building.
          
        * If installed by two different persons, it must normally be presumed that the installation was to enjoy the machinery alone.
       
        * APPLICATION TO THE PRESENT CASE: Land belonged to the Raja of Mandasa and was taken on lease by the plaintiff. A leasee will generally not want to attach anything permanently to the land hired, for its benefit. The attachment of the machinery will generally be for the beneficial use of the machinery alone. Here too, unless contrary is shown, it will be presumed that the cinema equipment and oil engine was attached temporarily, during the time of the lease, and not for the permanent beneficial enjoyment of the property but for the purpose of running the touring talkies, which itself was a temporary establishment. 
       
        * **Where the building or land or factory is taken on lease for a term by a lease and he installs certain machinery on the property during the lease period, it has to be held that his object and purpose of installing the machinery was the beneficial enjoyment of the very machinery during the period of his lease.**   
     
* **FINAL DECISION:** Machinery must be held to have not been attached to the earth within the meaning of the expression “attached to the earth under Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act. The machinery is not only not attached to the earth, but also not permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth

### Other Observations

* A suit for declaration of title to or for recovery of possession of immovable property can be filed **within 12 years from the date of the refusal or denial** of the plaintiff’s right by the opposing party.


* In the case of movable property, such a suit must be filed within 3 years.
