## Observations of the Court and Decision

* Court Observed that S.155(4), CrPC creates a legal fiction (an assertion that is accepted as true for legal purposes, even though it may be untrue or unproven) and provides that if a case comprised of several offences (both cognizable and non cognizable), it would not be open to the police to investigate the cognizable offences only and omit the non-cognizable offences.

* Thus, whole case is to be treated as cognizable and police has no option but to investigate the whole of the case and to submit a charge-sheet in respect of all the offences in that case. Non cognizable offences in that case cannot be omitted from being investigated.

* Court also recalled its decision in Pravin Chandra Mody v State of A.P. (AIR
1965 SC 1185) where it was held that while investigating a cognizable offence and presenting a charge-sheet for it, the police are not debarred from investigating any non-cognizable offence arising out of the same facts and including them in the charge-sheet.
