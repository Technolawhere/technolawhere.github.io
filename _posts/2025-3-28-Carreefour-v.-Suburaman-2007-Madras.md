# Carreefour v. Suburaman 2007 (35) PTC 225(Mad.)


## Facts

*   **Carrefour**, a French company claiming to be one of the largest retailers, filed Suit C.S. No 73 of 2007 against the defendants seeking permanent injunctions to restrain them from using the trademark "CARREFOUR" and the “C” logo in various ways, including manufacturing, marketing, selling, exporting, offering for sale, advertising, using as a trade name, printing, reproducing, and using as a domain name. Carrefour also sought the surrender and destruction of all stocks bearing the impugned trademarks and damages of Rs. 20,00,000.
*   Pending the suit, Carrefour filed six interlocutory applications (O.A. Nos. 100 to 105 of 2007) seeking interim injunctions with similar restraining orders.
*   On 1.2.2007, the Court granted ad interim injunctions in all six applications.
*   The respondents (defendants) filed Application Nos. 2014 to 2019 of 2007 to vacate these interim injunction orders. All applications were taken up together for disposal.
*   The second respondent, the wife of the third respondent and claiming to be the Proprietor of the fourth respondent, filed a common counter-affidavit and separate applications to vacate the injunctions.
*   In their counter-affidavits, the second respondent clarified that the first respondent has nothing to do with their business and that they stopped using the “C” logo from 2002.
*   Carrefour filed additional documents showing the visiting card of the first respondent representing the fourth respondent.
*   Carrefour claims user of the "CARREFOUR" trademark since 1960 in France, where the first store opened on 8.4.1960. They claim to be the largest retailer in Europe and the second largest worldwide, with a vast network, employees, and sales turnover.
*   The respondents do not dispute that "CARREFOUR" is a French word meaning "crossroad" or Carrefour's global presence. However, they argue that the mark is not well-known and that Carrefour, being only in retail, could not have acquired trans-border reputation for all products. They claim to have used the name "CARREFOUR" since 2000.
*   Carrefour has secured/filed approximately 2,500 registrations/applications for "CARREFOUR" and the “C” logo in about 80 countries, including for 'furniture' under Class 20.
*   Carrefour has Indian Trade Marks Registry registrations for several products in Classes 16, 25, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 35 under registration numbers 651900 to 651905 (for "CARREFOUR") and 651895 to 651899 (for “C” logo), secured on 12.1.1995. These registrations are due for renewal in 2009.
*   None of Carrefour's Indian registrations or applications relate to "Furniture" in Class 20.
*   The respondents applied for registration of the "CARREFOUR" trademark for furniture under Application No. 1046701 dated 21.9.2001, which was advertised in the Trade Marks Journal.

## Legal Questions Before the Court

The primary legal questions before the court relate to:

*   Whether Carrefour is entitled to interim injunctions restraining the respondents from using the "CARREFOUR" trademark and “C” logo, particularly in relation to furniture, despite not having a registration for furniture in India.
*   Whether Carrefour's trademark "CARREFOUR" can be considered a well-known trademark in India despite their lack of direct retail operations in India at the time of the suit.
*   Whether the respondents' use of the "CARREFOUR" trademark since 2000 constitutes infringement or passing off.
*   Whether Carrefour's delay in filing the suit amounts to acquiescence.
*   Whether the respondents' application for registration of the trademark and alleged honest adoption provide them with a valid defense.

## Observations of the Court on the Seven Contentions 

1.  **First Contention: Suppression of Communication dated 9.9.2003:**
    *   The respondents argued that Carrefour suppressed a letter from their counsel dated 9.9.2003.
    *   The court observed that Carrefour explained this as an omission by their previous counsel.
    *   The court examined the letter and found that it merely reiterated the contents of an earlier letter and contained no new material facts that would have changed the outcome.
    *   **Court's Answer:** The court did not accept this contention, stating that the disclosure of the letter would not have tilted the balance in favor of the respondents.

2.  **Second Contention: Lack of International/Trans-border Reputation due to Retail Business:**
    *   The respondents contended that Carrefour, being only in retail, could not have acquired international or trans-border reputation.
    *   The court found this contention inconsistent with the respondents having conceded to Carrefour's claim regarding the “C” logo and ceasing its use after receiving a cease and desist notice. The respondents did not explain why this logic would not apply to the "CARREFOUR" name.
    *   The court also noted that Carrefour's numerous worldwide registrations (2500) and 12 Indian registrations suggest the acquisition of a global reputation.
    *   **Court's Answer:** The court rejected this contention, stating that Carrefour had established a prima facie presence in several countries under the same trademark.

3.  **Third and Fourth Contentions: "CARREFOUR" not a Well-Known Mark and Lack of Indian Registration/Business in Furniture:**
    *   The respondents argued that "CARREFOUR" is not a well-known mark according to Section 2(1)(zg) read with Section 11(6) and (7) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, and that Carrefour's lack of registration and business in furniture in India proves they have no rights over it. They emphasized Carrefour's admission of not having direct retail operations in India due to government policy.
    *   Carrefour's counsel drew attention to Section 11(8) and (9), which state that the Registrar can consider a trademark well-known if a court or registrar in India has determined it so, and that use or registration in India is not a prerequisite.
    *   The court observed that Section 11 primarily deals with grounds for refusal of registration, and the present case is primarily an action for passing off, not registration.
    *   The court noted that the concept of a "well-known trade mark" under Section 2(1)(zg) aims to protect marks even for different goods if public association exists. The old Act did not have this definition.
    *   The court acknowledged that while Carrefour lacks furniture registration in India, they have it in other countries and have registrations for other goods in India. This suggests a likelihood of public confusion if the respondents use the same mark for furniture.
    *   The court also pointed out Carrefour's establishment of a Liaison Office in India and their "Global Sourcing Agreements," indicating a presence in India.
    *   The court cited the definitions of "trade mark" and "well-known trade mark," emphasizing that they protect proprietors even against exploitation for different types of goods if there is a likelihood of public confusion.
    *   The court distinguished the judgments relied upon by the respondents, such as *Rob Mathys India Pvt. Ltd v. Synthes Ag Chur* and *Sears Roebuck and Company v. Happy House (TV) Mfg. Co. Pvt. Ltd.*, finding the principles in *Rob Mathys* regarding promoting commercial morality and discouraging unethical trade practices more relevant. The court noted Carrefour's registration in India for similar products like office requisites. It disagreed with the *Sears Roebuck* case's emphasis on identical business activity, citing Carrefour's established goodwill and international registrations.
    *   The court also distinguished *Smithkline Beecham PIc. v. Hindustan Lever Limited* and *The Gillette Company v. A.K. Stationery*, emphasizing the principle of protecting trans-border reputation and frowning upon the appropriation of foreign proprietors' marks. The cases before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (*Champagne Moet and Chandon v. Moet's* and *Jolen Inc. v. Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks*) were also distinguished as they were at a later stage involving detailed evidence.
    *   **Court's Answer:** The court did not explicitly state that "CARREFOUR" is a well-known mark within the context of registration refusal but emphasized the likelihood of public confusion due to Carrefour's established global reputation and Indian presence, supporting an action for passing off. The lack of Indian registration in furniture was not considered fatal to Carrefour's case in a passing off action.

4.  **Fifth Contention: Acquiescence due to Delay:**
    *   The respondents argued that Carrefour was guilty of acquiescence by not filing the suit until February 2007, more than three years after their last communication in September 2003. They cited Section 33 of the Act.
    *   The court pointed out that Section 33 requires acquiescence for a continuous period of five years in the use of a **registered** trademark, with the proprietor of the earlier mark being aware of such use. The respondents had not obtained registration.
    *   The court also noted that the exchange of notices started in June 2002, and the suit was filed within five years from that date.
    *   The court referred to the Supreme Court's judgment in *Ramdev Food Products Pvt Ltd v. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel*, which defined acquiescence as sitting by while another invades rights and spends money, or a course of conduct inconsistent with a claim for exclusive rights, implying positive acts, not mere silence.
    *   **Court's Answer:** The court rejected the contention of acquiescence as the preconditions of Section 33 were not met and Carrefour's actions did not constitute acquiescence as defined by the Supreme Court.

5.  **Sixth Contention: Respondents' Application for Registration:**
    *   The respondents highlighted their application for registration of the "CARREFOUR" trademark for furniture dated 21.9.2001, advertised in the Trade Marks Journal on 15.5.2005, without any opposition.
    *   Carrefour's counsel pointed out a second advertisement on 1.11.2006, with the opposition period not yet expired.
    *   The court cited a Division Bench ruling in *Nalli Sambasivam v. The Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks*, stating that the date of advertisement is when the journal is first published and available for circulation.
    *   **Court's Answer:** The court held that the respondents' application for registration and the lack of opposition until the first advertisement did not help their case, especially considering the subsequent re-advertisement.

6.  **Seventh Contention: Honest Adoption:**
    *   The respondents claimed honest adoption of the trademark since Carrefour had not used it for furniture in India before them (since July 2000). They cited Section 11(11) and Section 34 of the Act.
    *   The court clarified that Section 11 deals with registration refusal and that even if Section 11(11) (protection for trademarks registered or acquired through use in good faith before the Act's commencement) applied, the respondents had not proven "good faith". The court questioned why the respondents would adopt a French word already in use globally by Carrefour without any explanation.
    *   Regarding Section 34 (protection for vested rights of prior users), the court stated that it actually operates in favor of Carrefour as the prior user of the mark globally.
    *   The court concluded that the respondents had only established "adoption," not "honest adoption," given Carrefour's prior global use and registrations, including for furniture in other countries, and the lack of explanation for the respondents' adoption of the French word.
    *   **Court's Answer:** The court rejected the contention of honest adoption, finding that the respondents failed to prove honesty in adopting a well-established foreign trademark.

## Answers to the Legal Questions Raised

*   **Whether Carrefour is entitled to interim injunctions despite lacking furniture registration in India?** Yes, the court found Carrefour had established a prima facie case for passing off based on their global reputation, prior registration for other goods in India, and the likelihood of public confusion, even without specific furniture registration in India.
*   **Whether "CARREFOUR" can be considered a well-known trademark in India?** While the court did not explicitly declare it a "well-known trade mark" for registration purposes under Section 11, it acknowledged its widespread recognition and global reputation, which is crucial for a passing off action.
*   **Whether the respondents' use constitutes infringement or passing off?** The court focused on passing off, as Carrefour did not have a specific registration for furniture in India. It found a prima facie case of passing off due to the likelihood of public deception.
*   **Whether Carrefour's delay amounts to acquiescence?** No, the court rejected the argument of acquiescence as the conditions under Section 33 of the Trade Marks Act were not met.
*   **Whether the respondents' application and alleged honest adoption provide a defense?** No, the court found the respondents' adoption not to be "honest" and their registration application was still pending and did not negate Carrefour's rights in a passing off action.

## Final Decision of the Court

The court **allowed all six applications for interim injunctions (O.A. Nos. 100 to 105 of 2007)** and **dismissed the applications for vacating the injunctions (A. Nos. 2014 to 2019 of 2007)**. The court concluded that Carrefour had established a prima facie case, the balance of convenience was in their favor, and they would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction was refused.
