# Notes on Property Law and Transfer of Property Act 1882

This post will see periodic updation. Updates will have dates indicated against new additions.

## Introduction  

* Commenced on 17<sup>st</sup> February, 1882

* Came into force on 1<sup>st</sup> of July, 1882
  
* Not exhaustive in nature and doesn’t cover the entire domain of transfer of property
  
* Does not cover transfers
  
   * By Operation of law: Cases of inheritance, insolvency, forfeiture, 
 
   * By Order of Court: like in case of execution of decree
 
   * According to rules of transfer in Muslim Law
 
* Covers only transfer of property ***inter vivos*** (voluntary transfer of property between one living person to another. Thus, would not include transfer by will.)

## Property 

* Word "Property" has not been defined in TPA, 1882

* However, it is dealt with in a wide sense under the act

* Classification:
  
   1. Tangible (any property that can be touched), further classified as below:
     
      1. Movable: Dealt under Sale of Goods Act, 1930
        
      2. Immovable: Dealt under TPA, 1882
        
   2. Intangible (any property that can't be touched, like IPR and brand identity)

## Immovable Property:

* Not defined under TPA. Talked of u/s 3 of TPA:

> “immoveable property” does not include standing timber, growing crops or grass

* Immovable property has been defined as under in the under mentioned acts:

   * General Clauses Act, 1897, u/s 3(26):
     
     > “immovable property” shall include land, benefits to arise out of land, and things attached to 
the earth, or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth

   * Registration Act, 1908, u/s 2(6):

     > “Immovable Property” includes land, buildings, hereditary allowances, rights to ways, lights, 
ferries, fisheries or any other benefit to arise out of land, and things attached to the earth, or 
permanently fastened to anything which is attached to the earth, but not standing timber, growing 
crops nor grass

 * Thus, immovable property can broadly be said to consist of:
   
      * Land: included what is below, what is on it (like water) and what is above it (the column of space above it)
  
      * Benefits arising out of land (Related: *Profits a prendre*:
        
         * Term included in the definition as under Registration act
       
         * Includes right of way, light, ferries, fisheries, hereditary allowances
       
         * Other Examples:
  
            * Right to collect dues from a fair
          
            * Office of a hereditary priest in a temple
          
            * Widow's life interest in the income generated from the property of the husband
       
         * *Profits a prendre*: A right, privilege, or interest that allows one to use the soil or products (as fish and game) of another's property
       
     * Things attached to Earth: (Related: *Doctrine of Fixtures* )
  
        * Defined u/s 3, TPA, 1882:
      
          > “attached to the earth” means—
          > 
          > (a) rooted in the earth, as in the case of trees and shrubs;
          > 
          > (b) imbedded in the earth, as in the case of walls or buildings; or
          > 
          > (c) attached to what is so imbedded for the permanent beneficial enjoyment of that to which it is
          > 
          > attached

        * Tests to determine whether a movable property has acquired an immovable nature based on how it is attached to an immovable property:
           1. Degree/ Mode of annexation:
  
              * Rule evolved in Holland v. Hodgson, 1872, LR7CP328
             
              * According to this, if the movable property is resting on the land on its own weight and nothing else then it is considered to be movable property, unless proved otherwise. However, if it is fastened to the land even slightly or is made to go deeper into the land by an external agent then it is considered to be as immovable property unless contrary is proved.
             
              * E.g. Stumps forming the wicket, buried in a cricket stadium, would be an immovable property
       
           2. Object or purpose of annexation:
             
              * Here, the purpose for which the annexation is made is analysed.
             
              * If the movable property is so attached to the immovable property, so as to permanently benefit that immovable property, its nature transforms to immovable. E.g. Fans attached to the ceiling of a house are attached for permanent beneficial enjoyment of the house and thus they would be treated as immovable in nature.
             
              * However, if movable property is attached to serve a temporary purpose, then it would not become an immovable property solely because it is attached to an immovable property. E.g. a tenant fixing a light fixture in the rented accommodation doesn't do so with the intention to permanently benefit the house.
             
              * Thus, circumstances of each case along with the underlying intention are important factors to consider.
