# Notes on Property Law and Transfer of Property Act 1882

This post will see periodic updation. Updates will have dates indicated against new additions.

## Introduction  

* Commenced on 17<sup>st</sup> February, 1882

* Came into force on 1<sup>st</sup> of July, 1882
  
* Not exhaustive in nature and doesn’t cover the entire domain of transfer of property
  
* Does not cover transfers
  
   * By Operation of law: Cases of inheritance, insolvency, forfeiture, 
 
   * By Order of Court: like in case of execution of decree
 
   * According to rules of transfer in Muslim Law
 
* Covers only transfer of property ***inter vivos*** (voluntary transfer of property between one living person to another. Thus, would not include transfer by will.)

## Property 

* Word "Property" has not been defined in TPA, 1882

* However, it is dealt with in a wide sense under the act

* Classification:
  
   1. Tangible (any property that can be touched), further classified as below:
     
      1. Movable: Dealt under Sale of Goods Act, 1930
        
      2. Immovable: Dealt under TPA, 1882
        
   2. Intangible (any property that can't be touched, like IPR and brand identity)

## Immovable Property:

* Not defined under TPA. Talked of u/s 3 of TPA:

> “immoveable property” does not include standing timber, growing crops or grass

* Immovable property has been defined as under in the under mentioned acts:

   * General Clauses Act, 1897, u/s 3(26):
     
     > “immovable property” shall include land, benefits to arise out of land, and things attached to 
the earth, or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth

   * Registration Act, 1908, u/s 2(6):

     > “Immovable Property” includes land, buildings, hereditary allowances, rights to ways, lights, 
ferries, fisheries or any other benefit to arise out of land, and things attached to the earth, or 
permanently fastened to anything which is attached to the earth, but not standing timber, growing 
crops nor grass

 * Thus, immovable property can broadly be said to consist of:
   
      * Land: included what is below, what is on it (like water) and what is above it (the column of space above it)
  
      * Benefits arising out of land (Related: *Profits a prendre*:
        
         * Term included in the definition as under Registration act
       
         * Includes right of way, light, ferries, fisheries, hereditary allowances
       
         * Other Examples:
  
            * Right to collect dues from a fair
          
            * Office of a hereditary priest in a temple
          
            * Widow's life interest in the income generated from the property of the husband
       
         * *Profits a prendre*: A right, privilege, or interest that allows one to use the soil or products (as fish and game) of another's property
       
     * Things attached to Earth: (Related: *Doctrine of Fixtures* )
  
        * Defined u/s 3, TPA, 1882:
      
          > “attached to the earth” means—
          > 
          > (a) rooted in the earth, as in the case of trees and shrubs;
          > 
          > (b) imbedded in the earth, as in the case of walls or buildings; or
          > 
          > (c) attached to what is so imbedded for the permanent beneficial enjoyment of that to which it is
          > 
          > attached

        * Tests to determine whether a movable property has acquired an immovable nature based on how it is attached to an immovable property:
           1. Degree/ Mode of annexation:
  
              * Rule evolved in Holland v. Hodgson, 1872, LR7CP328
             
              * According to this, if the movable property is resting on the land on its own weight and nothing else then it is considered to be movable property, unless proved otherwise. However, if it is fastened to the land even slightly or is made to go deeper into the land by an external agent then it is considered to be as immovable property unless contrary is proved.
             
              * E.g. Stumps forming the wicket, buried in a cricket stadium, would be an immovable property
       
           2. Object or purpose of annexation:
             
              * Here, the purpose for which the annexation is made is analysed.
             
              * If the movable property is so attached to the immovable property, so as to permanently benefit that immovable property, its nature transforms to immovable. E.g. Fans attached to the ceiling of a house are attached for permanent beneficial enjoyment of the house and thus they would be treated as immovable in nature.
             
              * However, if movable property is attached to serve a temporary purpose, then it would not become an immovable property solely because it is attached to an immovable property. E.g. a tenant fixing a light fixture in the rented accommodation doesn't do so with the intention to permanently benefit the house.
             
              * Thus, circumstances of each case along with the underlying intention are important factors to consider.

* State of Orissa v. Titaghur Paper Mills Company Limited, AIR 1985 SC 1293 : (1985) Supp SCC 280


## Movable Property

* Not defined in TPA

>"movable property" shall mean property of every description, except immovable property;

* Examples include:
  
   * Standing Timber
     
   * Growing Crops
     
   * Grass
 
   * A machinery not attached to earth and which can be shifted from one place to another.

## Differences between Immovable and Movable Property

| S. No. | Immovable Property | Movable Property |
| -------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1. | S.3 of General Clauses Act: <br />Land, benefits arising out <br />of it and things attached to earth | S.2 Sale of Goods Act: <br />every kind of moveable property <br />other than actionable claims <br />and money; and includes stock <br />and shares, growing crops, <br />grass, and things attached to or <br />forming part of the land which <br />are agreed to be severed <br />before sale or under the contract <br />of sale |
| 2. | Fixed to earth even slightly <br />or caused to go deeper by an <br />external agent | if resting on its own weight, <br />presumption of it being movable |
| 3. | Purpose of annexation is to <br />confer permanent benefit to land | Purpose of annexation is for <br />enjoyment of chattel alone |
| 4. | Registration is req. if <br />value of property is above <br />Rs.99 (S.54) | No registration is required |

## Attestation

* S.3 of TPA, 1882 defines attestation as:

> “attested”, in relation to an instrument, means and shall be deemed always to have 
meant attested by two or more witnesses each of whom has seen the executant sign or affix 
his mark to the instrument, or has seen some other person sign the instrument in the 
presence and by the direction of the executant, or has received from the executant a personal 
acknowledgement of his signature or mark, or of the signature of such other person, and 
each of whom has signed the instrument in the presence of the executant; but it shall not be 
necessary that more than one of such witnesses shall have been present at the same time, and 
no particular form of attestation shall be necessary

Other Relevant Provisions:

* S.59 of TPA, 1882:
> Mortgage when to be by assurance -
>
> Where the principal money secured is one hundred 
rupees or upwards, a mortgage 5[other than a mortgage by deposit of title-deeds] can be effected only 
by a registered instrument signed by the mortgagor and attested by at least two witnesses.
>
> 
> Where the principal money secured is less than one hundred rupees, a mortgage may be 
effected either by (a registered instrument) signed and attested as aforesaid, or (except in the 
case of a simple mortgage) by delivery of the property.

* Components of Valid Attestation:
  
   1. Two or more attesting witnesses
 
   2. Ordinarily necessary that each witness must see:
      
      3. **Executant sign** or put his mark
         
      5. Or **some other person sign** the instrument **in presence and by direction** of executant
     
      6. or should have **received from executant personal acknowledgement** of either of the above-mentioned acts
        
         Thus, witnessing actual execution of the deed is not necessary

   3. Each witness must attest in the presence of the executant
 
   4. Attestation must be done only after execution is complete, otherwise not valid. (Sant Lal v. Kamla Prasad 1952 SC)
 
   5. All witnesses need not attest at the same time
 
   6. No particular form of attestation need be adhered to
 
   7. Attestation does not estop the attestant. Her signing is no proof that she is aware of the contents of the document.
 
   8. Mere presence of the signature of the attestant is insufficient. There should be *Animo Attestandi* (i.e. intention to attest) as well. See M.L. Abdul Jabbar Sahib v. H. Venkata Sastri, AIR 1969 SC 1147 : (1969) 1 SCC 573.
 
   9. A person who is a party to transfer cannot be an attesting witness but party interested in transaction can be a witness.

### Difference between English and Indian Law:

Under English law, attestation based on personal acknowledgement is not valid. The attesting witnesses should be present at the time of execution of the deed. Attestation based on personal acknowledgement is not valid. 

However, under the Indian law, there is no such requirement. The witnesses can attest the document after it has been executed and they have received personal acknowledgement from the parties for whom they are attesting. 
 
### Cases related to Attestation

* [Kumar Harish Chandra Singh Deo v. Bansidhar Mohanty, AIR 1965 SC 1738 : (1966) 1 SCR 153](https://pranavsaksena.com/posts/Kumar-Harish-Chandra-Singh-Deo-v.-Bansidhar-Mohanty-1965-SC/)

* [M.L. Abdul Jabbar Sahib v. H. Venkata Sastri, AIR 1969 SC 1147 : (1969) 1 SCC 573](https://pranavsaksena.com/posts/M.L.-Abdul-Jabbar-Sahib-v.-H.-Venkata-Sastri-1969-SC/)

## Notice

S.3 TPA, 1882 talks about notice in the following way:

> “a **person is said to have notice**” of a fact when he actually knows that fact, or when, but for wilful 
abstention from an enquiry or search which he ought to have made, or gross negligence, he would have 
known it.
>
> Explanation I - Where any transaction relating to immovable property is required by law to be 
and has been effected by a registered instrument, any person acquiring such property or any part of, 
or share or interest in, such property shall be deemed to have notice of such instrument as from the 
date of registration...
>
> Explanation II - Any person acquiring any immoveable property or any share or interest in 
any such property shall be deemed to have notice of the title, if any, of any person who is for the 
time being in actual possession thereof. 
> 
> Explanation III - A person shall be deemed to have had notice of any fact if his agent acquires 
notice thereof whilst acting on his behalf in the course of business to which that fact is material:
>
> Provided that, if the agent fraudulently conceals the fact, the principal shall not be charged 
with notice thereof as against any person who was a party to or otherwise cognizant of the fraud.
>

* From the above definition, notices can be divided into 3 types:
  
   1. Actual or express notice
      
   3. Implied or constructive notice
      
   5. Imputed notice (explanation III, notice to the agent, imputed to her principal)

### Actual Notice (aka Express Notice)

Actual notice = Definite information + given by person interested + given in the same transaction 

### Constructive Notice (aka Implied Notice)

* A person is said to have constructive notice in those situations when he would have had an actual notice had he made those enquiries which a reasonable person would have made in the same situation.

* Knowledge of such a notice is imputed by the court in the following cases:

   1. **Wilful absentation from an enquiry or search which ought to have been made**

      * Conscious and deliberate
     
      * Must be with some purpose or design
      
      * There should be a desire to avoid asking questions
     
      * E.g.: A person refusing a registered letter containing some information regarding a property he is planning to purchase will be deemed to have the information so contained (Joginder v. Dwarkar 15 Cal 681)
     
      * Case Laws:

         * Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation v. Haji Abdul Gafur Haji Hussenbhai, AIR 1971 SC 1201 ; (1971) 1 SCC 757 

   3. **Gross Negligence**

      * Does not mean carelessness but aggravated carelessness which indicates mental indifference to obvious risks
     
      * E.g. in **Imperial Bank of India v U. Raj Gyaw (1923) 50 IA 283**, it was held that a purchaser, who after being informed that the title-deeds were in possession of a bank for safekeeping, failed to make inquiries from the bank, was grossly negligent and notice of bank's rights over the deeds was imputed to him. 
 
   5. **Registration**

      * Given under S.3, Explanation I
        >
        > Explanation I - Where any transaction relating to immovable property is required by law to be 
and has been effected by a registered instrument, any person acquiring such property or any part of, 
or share or interest in, such property shall be deemed to have notice of such instrument as from the 
date of registration...
        >
     
      * Following 3 conditions must be satisfied:

        1. It must be compulsory to register the instrument. Thus, registration is no notice in cases where getting the deed registered is optional.
       
        2. Registration must be done strictly according to the manner prescribed by Indian Registration Act.
       
        3. Information entered into the registers and indices must be correct.   
 
   7. **Actual Possession**
      
      * Given under s.3, Explanation II:
      >
      > Explanation II - Any person acquiring any immoveable property or any share or interest in 
any such property shall be deemed to have notice of the title, if any, of any person who is for the 
time being in actual possession thereof. 
      >  
     
      *  De facto possession amounts to notice of title in another.
     
      *  Makes the factum of possession act as a notice of rights of the possessor.
     
      *  Amount of property possessed out of the whole is also a relevant factor.
     
      *  Case Laws:

         * Md. Mustafa v. Haji Md. Isa, AIR 1987 Pat 5
       
         * H.N.Narayanaswamy Naidu v. Deveeramma, AIR 1981 Kant 93
       
         * Ram Niwas v. Bano, AIR 2000 SC 2921 : (2000) 6 SCC 685
 
   9. **Notice to agent**
      
      * Given under s.3, Explanation III:
      > Explanation III - A person shall be deemed to have had notice of any fact if his agent acquires 
notice thereof whilst acting on his behalf in the course of business to which that fact is material:
      >
      > Provided that, if the agent fraudulently conceals the fact, the principal shall not be charged 
with notice thereof as against any person who was a party to or otherwise cognizant of the fraud.
      > 
     
      * Based on the maxim **Qui facit per alium facit per se**, i.e. he who does by another, does by himself.
     
      * Principal deemed to have notice of any fact which his agent has come to know of when:
         
         1. Agent is acting on his behalf
         
         2. During the course of business
       
         3. To which business that fact is relevant
     
      * Note: If agent acts fraudulently, principal cannot be charged with notice
     
      * Notice is imputed to the principal irrespective of the fact whether the agent did actually communicate the information to her principal or not.
     
      * Underlying principle is that no person must be allowed to escape the doctrine of notice by employing an agent.
     
      * E.g. In **Mohori Bibee v. D Ghosh 1903 30 Cal 539**, the principal was deemed to have notice of petitioner's age even though he had not been personally involved in the transactions and everything was being done by his agent alone.
