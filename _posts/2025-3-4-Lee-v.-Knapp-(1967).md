# Lee v. Knapp (1967) 2 Q.B. 442

## Facts:

*   The defendant, the managing director of a clothing manufacturing company, drove a company van to demonstrate its ease of handling to the company's van driver.

*   During this demonstration, the van damaged Mr. Strachan's car.

*   The defendant left the scene; however, the transport manager arrived shortly after and exchanged particulars with Mr. Strachan.

*   Police interviewed the defendant at his office. He admitted to driving the van but stated he had stopped. He also admitted that he had not personally provided his name and address as required by law.

## Legal Questions and Answers:

*   **Central Legal Question:** Did the defendant breach Section 77 (1) of the Road Traffic Act, 1960, by leaving the scene of the accident without providing his name and address, even though the transport manager exchanged particulars with the car owner?

    *   **Answer:** Yes, the court ruled that the defendant did breach Section 77 (1) because the **driver has a personal, non-transferable duty to stop and provide information**.

*   **Subsidiary Questions and Answers:**

    *   **What constitutes "stopping" as required by Section 77 (1) of the Road Traffic Act, 1960?**

        *   **Answer:** "Stopping" means that the driver must stop and remain at the scene for a sufficient period to allow those with reasonable grounds to request and receive the required information directly from the driver.

    *   **Can the driver delegate the duty to provide information to another person, such as a transport manager?**

        *   **Answer:** No, the court found that it is the **driverâ€™s own personal obligation to stay** for such a period and personally provide the information. Allowing delegation would be unsatisfactory and could lead to disputes.

    *   **Is a momentary pause sufficient to satisfy the requirement to stop?**

        *   **Answer:** No, a momentary pause is not enough. The driver must stop for a period that is reasonable to enable the exchange of information.

## Contentions:

*   The defendant stopped, but did not personally give the required information.
*   The defendant's transport manager provided the required information.

## Observations:

*   The court considered the meaning of "stopped" in Section 77 (1) of the Road Traffic Act, 1960.

*   The court referenced a South Australian case, *Noblet v. Condon*, which construed similar wording in the South Australia Road Traffic Act, 1934.

*   The court emphasized that the driver has a personal obligation to stop and provide information.

*   The court adopted the view of Napier J. in *Noblet v. Condon* that the driver must stop for a period that is reasonable to allow for the exchange of information.

*   The magistrate found that the defendant did not remain at the scene long enough to allow Mr. Strachan or anyone else to request particulars and that the defendant did not personally give his name or address.

## Provisions of Law:

*   **Section 77 (1) of the Road Traffic Act, 1960**: This section mandates that if an accident occurs due to the presence of a motor vehicle on a road, causing damage to another vehicle, the driver of the motor vehicle must stop. Further, the driver must provide their name and address, as well as the owner's name and address and the vehicle's identification marks, if required by a person with reasonable grounds.

## Decision:

*   The court upheld the conviction, finding that the defendant did not fulfill his personal obligation to stop and provide the necessary information.

*   The phrase "the driver of the motor vehicle shall stop" in Section 77 (1) of the Road Traffic Act, 1960, means that the driver must stop and remain at the scene for a sufficient period to allow those with reasonable grounds to request and receive the required information directly from the driver.
