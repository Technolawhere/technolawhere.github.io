# Moot Problem On Constitutional Law

Republic of Bharati is a country which has various cultural and historical glories to its name. 
People from various backgrounds lived in harmony and abided by the laws of the land. Majority 
of the population worshipped deities personifying women as a symbol of Strength and 
Fearlessness. Paschim Pradesh is a State of Republic of Bharati with a good literacy rate and 
the people believed in the Equality between Men and Women in all spheres of life. 

Ira was a young Advocate who had just passed her college and started practicing. She was very 
ambitious about her work and always worked for the poor and needy people free of cost. She 
was always the last one to leave her workplace and often took her personal vehicle to travel 
home from workplace. One such night, on 01-09-2023 around 9:30 P.M. she was returning 
from workplace on her scooty, where she noticed four men desperately asking for help beside 
the highway. Out of generosity, she stopped her scooty and two men told her that they are 
tourists and one of their friends is laying injured at a distance. While she got down from her 
scooty, two of them accompanied her to a distant secluded place. 

On her way, she realized that her phone was inside the scooty, so she returned for taking the 
same and on return, she found that her two-wheeler tyre was punctured. Ira called her younger 
sister Arna at 9.35 p.m. to inform that her scooter had broken down and she was alone on the 
road. All of a sudden, the two men, who had asked for help accompanied by two other men 
came towards her and started touching her in a wrong way. She got scared and slapped one of 
them, to which the men became angry and then dragged the girl to a distant place and raped 
her one by one. In the fear of not getting caught, the four men put petroleum on her body and 
burnt her alive till she was dead and ran away towards the nearby village. 

On 08-09-2023 the partially burnt body was found at an underpass on the Paschim national 
highway by a farmer around 6 a.m. He informed the village sarpanch, who alerted the local 
police. After confirming that the victim was a female, the local police verified the recent 
women missing cases and then, with the help of the handbag and the scarf, the family members 
were able to recognise her.

The Police started various investigation procedures and discovered a CCTV footage which was 
placed near the highway for traffic control. By looking at the CCTV footage, the Police saw 
some faces where the recording timing showed around 10:00 P.M. based on which, they started 
searching for the four men who had run towards the village and started the enquiry. On 20-09-2023, based on its investigation, the Police arrested, Manas, Raju, Naval and Keshav. In the 
meantime, as soon as the news became viral, people all over the country started protesting and 
the news became trending all over social media and people demanded Justice for Ira. People 
from various political background as well as Film Industry and Media houses demanded speedy 
Justice and #KillTheRapists became viral all over the Country and the Government took 
initiative for a speedy disposal of the case.  

On 24-09-2023, the Police presented the four accused in front of the local Magistrate and 
requested for a 7 days remand for further investigation. Amidst the remand period, the entire 
Country protested with candle light marches and various High-Profile Personalities also got 
involved in the protests. On 03-10-2023, the Media flashed the news that the four accused had 
been shot dead by the Police while they were being taken to the Court. The Investigation In
Charge in the Interview stated that Naval and Keshav snatched the revolvers from the 
Constables while they were being taken to the Court, jumped out of the Police Van and fired 
two rounds in the air. Manas and Raju also followed them and tried to escape. The Police 
claimed that they found no other ways and had to shoot down the four accused otherwise the 
accused would have fled.

The killing of the accused in the alleged encounter  was  hailed  by  a  section  of  people, the  
families  of  the  deceased  and  human  rights  groups  alleged  that  the  police  took  law  into  
its hands, terming  this as extra-judicial killing. In the police press  conference  that  followed,  
questions  as  to  how  two  of  the  four  accused managed to  get hold of the  pistols in the 
presence  of 10  armed police  officers went unasked.

The families of the Four Accused also alleged that the police officers have framed the murder 
scene as they had threatened them when they went to the police station. The families informed 
the reporters that the police officers angrily made the statement to the families that the accused 
stand no chance of being saved from death as the entire Nation was against their act. 

 As soon as the News became viral, the entire Country rejoiced and supported the action of the 
Police and the same was called an “Act of Bravery” by various Political Leaders. But an NGO 
named as “Nagarik Suraksha” filed a Petition before the Hon’ble High Court of Paschim 
Pradesh. The Hon’ble High Court of Paschim Pradesh after hearing all the arguments of the 
case held “The Police had no other option but to shoot the four accused failing to which they 
would have fled and which would have triggered mass and widespread agitation throughout 
the Nation and the Role of the Police would have been in question. Therefore, the Court finds the Act of the Police as an Act of Bravery and sudden reflex to counter the situation which 
arose in front of them.” 

Families  of  the  four  accused who  were  gunned  down  by the  police  in  an  alleged  
encounter,  have  approached  the  Supreme  Court, seeking  registration  of  murder  case  
against  the  police  officers  involved.  Alleging  that  the youth  were  killed  in  a  stage
managed  gunfight,  the  families  filed  a  writ  petition  under  the provisions  of  Article  32  
of  the  Constitution  that  enables  individuals  to  seek  redressal  for  the violation of  their  
fundamental rights. 

The NGO, after the Judgment by the Hon’ble High Court, approached the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court on the contention of violation of Human Rights as well as the violation of Fundamental 
Rights guaranteed under the Constitution of Republic of Bharati. All the petitions have been 
clubbed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Republic of Bharati and stands pending before the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Republic of Bharati. 

Note: 
   1. The laws of the State of Republic of Bharati are in Pari materia with the laws of India.

## Statement of Jurisdiction

The Jurisdiction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Republic of Bharati has been invoked, by the parents of the deceased, under Article 32 of the Constitution of Republic of Bharati (hereinafter “the Constitution”). The same has been reproduced hereunder for ready reference:

**“Article 32. Remedies for enforcement of rights conferred by this Part. —**

   1. The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed.
      
   2. The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this Part.” 

## Statement of Facts

   1. On 1.09.2023 at around 9:30 P.M. Ira, a young girl, was going on her scooty when she stopped to help 4 men who were standing beside a highway. Two of them started to accompany her to a distant secluded place, telling her that their friend was lying injured there.  Upon realising that she had left her phone in the scooty, she went back and found her scooty punctured. At 9:35 P.M. she called her sister Arna and told her that her scooty had broken down and she was alone on the road.

   2. Suddenly, the two men, who had asked for help accompanied by two other men came towards her. After an altercation they dragged her to a distant place and raped her one by one. They then poured petroleum on her and burnt her alive till she was dead. Then they ran towards a nearby village.

   3. On 8.09.2023 at around 06:00 A.M., a farmer found the partially burnt body at an underpass on the Paschim National Highway. The Police was informed about it. The family members, who had filed a missing person report about Ira, identified the body of Ira with the help of her handbag and scarf.

   4. Police investigation recovered a CCTV footage from a camera placed near the highway. It showed some faces recorded at 10:00 P.M.. Based on this the Police carried out further investigation and enquiries and arrested Manas, Raju, Naval, Keshav on 20.09.2023. On 24.09.2023, the Police presented the four accused in front of the local Magistrate and requested for a 7 days remand for further investigation.

   5. This case caused a media frenzy and public uproar. The Government took initiative for speedy disposal of the case. Amidst the remand period, the entire country protested with candle light marches and various high-profile personalities also got involved in the protests.

   6. On 3.10.2023 the Media reported that the four accused had been shot dead by the Police while they were being taken to the Court. The Investigation In-Charge in the Interview stated that Naval and Keshav snatched the revolvers from the Constables while they were being taken to the Court, jumped out of the Police Van and fired two rounds in the air. Manas and Raju also followed them and tried to escape. The Police claimed that they found no other ways and had to take down the four accused otherwise they would have fled.

   7. The families of the deceased and the human right groups alleged that the Police took law in its own hands and termed this as an extra-judicial killing. The families also alleged that the police officers have framed the murder scene as they had threatened them when they went to the police station. That the Police officers angrily told them that the accused stand no chance of being saved from death as the entire Nation was against their act.

   8. Nagarik Suraksha, an NGO, filed a Petition before the Hon’ble High Court of Paschim Pradesh. The Hon’ble High Court after hearing all the arguments of the case held:

      “The Police had no other option but to shoot the four accused failing to which they would have fled and which would have triggered mass and widespread agitation throughout the Nation and the Role of the Police would have been in question. Therefore, the Court finds the Act of the Police as an Act of Bravery and sudden reflex to counter the situation which arose in front of them.”

   10. The NGO has now approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Republic of Bharati contending violation of Human Rights and Fundamental Rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The families of the deceased have also filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution before the Hon’ble Supreme Court seeking registration of murder case against the police officers involved alleging that the youth were killed in a stage-managed gunfight.

   11. Hon'ble Supreme Court has clubbed these petitions and the same are now pending before it.


## Summary of Arguments 

### Is the petition of the NGO maintainable in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Republic of Bharati? 

That since the conditions specified under Articles 32, 132, 133, 134, 134A and 136 are not met, the petition of the NGO should be dismissed *in limine* .

### Were Fundamental Rights given under Article 21 and Article 22 of the Constitution violated on the issues of custody and did it render subsequent custody illegal?

That as the facts are silent on this, considering that the judicial mind (at two levels: at magistrate level and then at a much higher level in the Hon’ble High Court) applied to all the facts and arguments of this case, did not specifically point out any such lacunae, if a presumption is to be made, it would tilt in favour of the view that conditions relating to production before magistrate within 24 hours of arrest and subsequent remand were fully met. Therefore, there was no violation of Fundamental Rights specified under Article 21 and 22 of the Constitution.

### Whether a person, arrested by the Police, has a right to escape from police custody if the Police continues to detain him beyond the period authorised by law?

That there is no right given to the accused to walk free on their own after their period of detention, as authorised by law, comes to an end. The remedy provided for such matters is only to approach a Court of law to seek bail. The act of snatching weapons from the police and trying to flee is grossly illegal. 

### Whether there was a violation of any Human Rights or Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, of the deceased, with respect to the Police Encounter?  

That there was no violation of Human Rights and Article 21 of the Constitution which guarantees right to life as a Fundamental Right, as the act of the policemen, which resulted in the death of the 4 accused, was not arbitrary and also strictly in accordance to the procedure established by law namely sections 41 and 46 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973.

### Did the encounter of the accused by the Police constitute a murder?

That Police were acting according to section 23 of the Police Act, 1861 and also in exercise of the right to private defence of body. Hence their act would not be a crime as it would be covered under sections 96, 97, 100 and 102 of the Penal Code, 1860.

### Whether the decision of the Hon’ble High Court of Paschim Pradesh needs to be upheld?

That the Hon’ble High Court’s decision is a sound decision based on impeccable logic and proper appreciation of the law and facts and should therefore be upheld.

## Arguments Advanced 

### Is the petition of the NGO maintainable in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Republic of Bharati? 

The NGO has approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Republic of Bharati contending violation of Human Rights and Fundamental Rights guaranteed under the Constitution. They have. 

It is not clear as to under what provisions the NGO has approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court. However, there are the following provisions under which the NGO could have approached the Hon’ble Court. These are considered in seriatim:

   * **Article 132 of the Constitution:**

      *(1)	An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree or final order of a High Court in the territory of India, whether in a civil, criminal or other proceeding, if the High Court certifies under article 134A that the case involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution.*

      ...

      *(3)	Where such a certificate is given, any party in the case may appeal to the Supreme Court on the ground that any such question as aforesaid has been wrongly decided*

      **Article 134A of the Constitution:**

      *Every High Court, passing or making a judgment, decree, final order, or sentence, referred to in clause (1) of article 132 or clause (1) of article 133, or clause (1) of article 134,-*

      *(a) may, if it deems fit so to do, on its own motion; and*

      *(b) shall, if an oral application is made, by or on behalf of the party aggrieved, immediately after the passing or making of such judgment, decree, final order or sentence,*

      *determine, as soon as may be after such passing or making, the question whether a certificate of the nature referred to in clause (1) of article 132, or clause (1) of article 133 or, as the case may be, sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of article 134, may be given in respect of that case.*

The NGO could not have approached The Hon’ble Supreme Court under Article 132 as the condition precedent for coming under Article 132 is the issuance of a certificate by the Hon’ble High Court. The facts do not show that any such certificate was issued by the Hon’ble High Court.

  *	**Article 133:**

      *(1) An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree or final order in a civil proceeding of a High Court in the territory of India if the High Court certifies under article 134A—*

      *a.	that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance; and*

      *b.	that in the opinion of the High Court the said question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court.*

      *(2) Notwithstanding anything in article 132, any party appealing to the Supreme Court under clause (1) may urge as one of the grounds in such appeal that a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution has been wrongly decided.*

      *(3) Notwithstanding anything in this article, no appeal shall, unless Parliament by law otherwise provides, lie to the Supreme Court from the judgment, decree or final order of one Judge of a High Court.*

The NGO could not have approached The Hon’ble Supreme Court under Article 133 as the condition precedent for coming under Article 133 is the issuance of a certificate by the Hon’ble High Court. The facts do not show that any such certificate was issued by the Hon’ble High Court.

   * **Article 134**:
      
      *(1)	An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, final order or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a High Court in the territory of India if the High Court-*

      *a.	has on appeal reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to death; or*

      *b.	has withdrawn for trial before itself any case from any court subordinate to its authority and has in such trial convicted the accused person and sentenced him to death; or*

      *c.	certifies under article 134A that the case is a fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court:*

      *i.	Provided that an appeal under sub-clause (c) shall lie subject to such provisions as may be made in that behalf under clause (1) of article 145 and to such conditions as the High Court may establish or require. (2) Parliament may by law confer on the Supreme Court any further powers to entertain and hear appeals from any judgment, final order or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a High Court in the territory of India subject to such conditions and limitations as may be specified in such law.*

The NGO also could not have approached The Hon’ble Supreme Court under Article 134 as the condition precedent for coming under Article 134 is either a sentencing of death of the accused or the issuance of a certificate by the Hon’ble High Court. The facts do not show the presence of either of the things.

   * **Article 136:**

      *(1) Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter, the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India.*

In this context reliance is placed upon certain decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court: 
In **Pritam Singh v. State, AIR 1950 SC 169** , the Constitution Bench held that while court has wide discretionary power under Article 136, yet it is to be exercised sparingly and in exceptional cases only *‘Court will not grant special leave, unless it is shown that exceptional and special circumstances exist, that substantial and grave injustice has been done and that the case in question presents features of sufficient gravity to warrant a review of the decision appealed against…’*

In **Mohammad Latief Magrey vs The Union Territory Of Jammu... Dated 12 September, 2022 (CIVIL APPEAL NO. 6544 OF 2022(@ SLP (C) NO.12743 OF 2022))**, it was observed that –

*“50. Thus, the principles of law discernible from the aforesaid are that unless, it is shown that exceptional and special circumstances exist; that substantial and grave injustice has been done and the case and question presents features of sufficient gravity to warrant a review of the decision appealed against, this Court would not exercise its overriding powers under Article 136 (1) of the Constitution. The wide discretionary power with which this Court is invested under Article 136 is to be exercised sparingly and in exceptional cases only. Keeping these principles in mind, we need to decide whether the relief prayed for by the appellant should be granted or not?...”*

On merits, as no infirmity or perpetuation of injustice has been pointed out against the Hon’ble High Court order, there is no ground for granting a special leave to admit a challenge against the order of the Hon’ble High Court.

   * **Petition under Article 32:**

Guidelines to be followed while filing petitions in the Hon’ble Supreme Court have been summarised by the Hon’ble Court in a document titled **“Compilation of Guidelines to be followed for entertaining letters/ petitions received”** and relevant parts have been mentioned under for ready reference:

*“Letter-petitions falling under the following categories alone will ordinarily be entertained as Public Interest Litigation:-*

*4. Petitions from jails complaining of harassment, for (pre-mature release) and seeking release after having completed 14 years in jail, death in jail, transfer, release on personal bond, speedy trial as a fundamental right.* 

*$ Petitions for premature release, parole etc. are not matters which deserve to be treated as petitions u/Article 32 as they can effectively be dealt with by the concerned High Court. To save time Registry may simultaneously call for remarks of the jail Superintendent and ask him to forward the same to High Court. The main petition may be forwarded to the concerned High Court for disposal in accordance with law. Even in regard to petitions containing allegations against Jail Authorities there is no reason why it cannot be dealt with by the High Court. But petitions complaining of torture, custody death and the like may be entertained by this Court directly if the allegations are of a serious nature.*

*$ Added based on Order dated 19.8.1993 of the then Chief Justice of India…*

*…Cases falling under the following categories will not be entertained as Public Interest Litigation and these may be returned to the petitioners or filed in the PIL Cell, as the case may be:*

*(3) Complaints against Central/ State Government Departments and Local Bodies except those relating to item Nos. (1) to (10) above.”*

The Hon’ble High Court, after being approached on the same allegations, and after having considered all the facts and arguments of the case, had decided that the action of the police officers was not in contravention of any laws of Bharati. Had there been any truth in those allegations, or some serious discrepancy in the procedure followed by the police, it would have been specifically highlighted in its decision. Since all facts and arguments have already been considered at the Hon’ble High Court and dismissed, the same should not be permitted in the Hon’ble Supreme Court under the guidelines drawn by it.

Based on the above facts and arguments, it is contended that the petition of the NGO should be dismissed *in limine.*

### Were Fundamental Rights given under Article 21 and Article 22 of the Constitution violated on the issues of custody and did it render subsequent custody illegal?

**Article 21 of the Constitution**, which guarantees right to life as a fundamental right, reads as under:

   *“No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.”*

**Article 22 of the Constitution**, which guarantees protection against arrest and detention in certain cases, reads as under:

   * *“(1) No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.*
     
   * *(2) Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate.”*

The facts are silent on if the deceased, upon their arrest, were produced before a magistrate within 24 hours. However, it is known that the local Magistrate, after considering the facts of the case from 20.09.2023 to 24.09.2023, did not highlight any violations but however granted remand for further investigation.  It is also known that the Hon’ble High Court of Paschim Pradesh, after considering all the facts and arguments of the case, did not highlight any discrepancy in the acts of the police with regards to custody. Hence, in the absence of facts on the issue, if one were to presume, based on the judicial orders and decisions of the above-mentioned judicial bodies, the presumption would tilt towards the view that there was no such non-production within 24 hours of arrest and hence no violation of any aforesaid Fundamental Rights has taken place.

Similarly, as the Hon’ble High Court, after considering all the facts and arguments of the case, did not highlight any violation with respect to illegal custody during the day of the encounter, presumption, in the absence of facts, would lean towards the accused being in lawful custody while being taken to the court on the day of the encounter. Hence no violation of Fundamental Rights whatsoever would have happened till the day of the encounter.
      
### Whether a person, arrested by the Police, has a right to escape from police custody if the police continues to detain him beyond the period authorised by the magistrate?

Without prejudice to submissions made in the preceding issue, even if for the sake of argument, it is presumed that there was non-production before a Magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest and even after the expiry of 7 day remand, no further remand was obtained, the question is whether this renders the police custody of the deceased at the time of their death, illegal?

It is conceded that if this was the case, then in terms of the decision of the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court, dated 28.03.2023 in the case of **Manoj Kumar Gupta vs State of U.P. And Another**, the police custody became illegal after 24 hours on account of non-production before the Magistrate. It has also been held in this case that this defect is not cured by the obtaining a subsequent remand from the mag. In such a situation, the arrested person becomes entitled to default bail under section 167 of the Cr.P.C.

The point to be noted is that there is no right given to the accused to walk free on their own after their period of detention, as authorised by law, comes to an end. The law provides remedy against such actions by means of seeking bail or by filing a writ petition in a court of law for any such irregular detentions. Nowhere does the law provide a right to the accused, who are in such a custody, to walk free from it on their own. The remedy only lies in a court of law. The attempt to escape made by the four accused on the day they were being taken to the Court was illegal because the police officers were doing their duty in taking them to the court and the accused, in trying to escape by assaulting the police officers were obstructing that duty.

### Whether there was a violation of any human rights or Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, of the deceased, with respect to the Police Encounter?  

That there was no violation of Human Rights and Article 21 of the Constitution which guarantees right to life as a fundamental right, as the acts of the policemen, which resulted in the death of the 4 accused was strictly in accordance to the procedure established by law. The justifications for this are submitted hereunder:

**Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights** provides: 
   
   1. *“Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.”*
      
Thus this Covenant only prohibits arbitrary deprivation of human life.

**Article 21 of the Constitution**, which guarantees right to life as a fundamental right, reads as under:

*“No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.”*

Thus, the Constitution allows a person to be deprived of his right to life as well as personal liberty according to the procedure established by law. The question then becomes whether there was a law and a procedure established thereby and whether the policemen acted according to it?

This question may be answered by considering the events that unfolded on the day of the encounter and how each unfolding event brought into play different provisions of law that subsequently commanded how the police ought to have acted in those developing situations. 

Let us consider **section 41 of Cr.P.C.**: 

*When police may arrest without warrant.*

*(1) Any police officer may without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant, arrest any person-*

*(a) who has been concerned in any cognizable offence, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made, or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists, of his having been so concerned; or*

…

…

*(e) who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty, or who has escaped, or attempts to escape, from lawful custody; or…*

When the four accused, namely Manas, Raju, Naval and Keshav, were being taken to the court, two of them snatched revolvers from the police and all four of them jumped out of the police van and tried to escape from custody. The moment they jumped out of the confines of the police van they were out of the physical reach, and hence the custody of the police officers, who were performing their duty of presenting the accused to the court. Since there was a reasonable suspicion on them, based on the police investigations, of having committed the cognizable offences of gang rape and murder which are punishable by death or imprisonment up to life under the laws of the country, and since they had obstructed the police officers while in execution of their duty of presenting them to the court, there were more than enough grounds to arrest, them without a warrant, according to the above-mentioned section. 

The procedure to make an arrest is given under **section 46 of the Cr.P.C.** mentioned hereunder:

*Arrest how made.*

*(1) In making an arrest the police officer or other person making the same shall actually touch or confine the body of the person to be arrested, unless there be a submission to the custody by word or action.*

*(2) If such person forcibly resists the endeavour to arrest him, or attempts to evade the arrest, such police officer or other person may use all means necessary to effect the arrest.*

*(3) Nothing in this section gives a right to cause the death of a person who is not accused of an offence punishable with death or with imprisonment for life.*

Since the four had forcibly resisted their arrest and snatched the revolvers from the police officers, and in order to evade arrest had jumped out of the van, fired in the air and started to flee, the above section empowered the police officers with all means necessary to effect their arrest.  The section goes on to say that if the accusation is of an offence punishable with death or with life imprisonment, the police action would not be against the provisions of this section, even if it caused death. The section also mentions that in making the arrest the police officer shall actually touch or confine the body of the person to be arrested. Since they had already jumped out of the police van, the police could neither physically touch nor confine the body of the persons to be arrested, within the van. In the absence of physical reach, and due to the possession of lethal weapons, which were loaded with bullets designed to grievously injure, the police were running out of options. The desperation of the accused to somehow escape, which they had demonstrated by being able to snatch weapons in the presence of ten armed police officers, posed a serious risk to the members of the public who could have been victims of injury from the weapons in the possession of the accused. The police was thus completely justified in using lethal force against the accused to stop them from evading arrest and that causing their death was neither arbitrary and nor in contravention of the procedure established by law. Hence there was no violation of Human Rights under Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 21 were not violated by the Police.

### Did the encounter of the accused by the Police constitute a murder?

Four accused had been shot dead by the Police while they were being taken to the Court. The Investigation In-Charge in the Interview stated that Naval and Keshav snatched the revolvers from the Constables while they were being taken to the Court, jumped out of the Police Van and fired two rounds in the air. Manas and Raju also followed them and tried to escape. 

**Section 76 of the Penal Code, 1860** deals with acts done by a person bound by law and states: 

*Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it.*

**Section 23 of the Police Act, 1861** deals with duties of police officers and states:

*It shall be the duty of every police-officer promptly to obey and execute all orders and warrants lawfully issued to him by any competent authority; to collect and communicate intelligence affecting the public peace; to prevent the commission of offences and public nuisances; to detect and bring offenders to justice and to apprehend all persons whom he is legally authorized to apprehend, and for whose apprehension sufficient ground exists; and it shall be lawful for every police-officer, for any of the purposes mentioned in this section, without a warrant, to enter and inspect any drinking-shop, gaming-house or other place of resort of loose and disorderly characters.*

The police officers are bound by the Police Act to perform their duties which includes prevention of the commission of offences and apprehending all those they legally should, failing which they would be penalised under the same Act. In performance of their duties in this case, they would have to follow the procedure established under Cr.P.C. The four accused, as argued above, where obstructing the police in performance of their duty to present them before the magistrate at the expiry of remand that was earlier given to them. The actions of the police, as the events unfolded before them, was completely justified as argued above. The use of lethal force against the accused to stop them from evading arrest was not in contravention to the procedure established by law. Thus, the act of the police being an act they were bound by law to do, would not be an offence as it would fall squarely under section 76 of the Penal Code. 

Moreover, **section 96 of the Penal Code** deals with things done in private defence and states: 

*Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence.*

**Section 97 of the Penal Code** deals with right of private defence of the body and of property and states:

*Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section 99, to defend—*

*First.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body…*

From the above-mentioned section and as seen from section 23 of the Police Act, the police had the right to protect themselves and the right as well as the duty to protect the members of the public who may be affected by a bodily injury caused by the acts of the escaping accused. 

**Section 102 of the Penal Code** which deals with Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body, states: 

*The right of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues.*

Thus, the right, with respect to the body of the police personnel, commenced as soon as a scuffle would have been started by the accused to snatch weapons from the police officers because their actions gave rise to an apprehension of grave danger to the body of those that were lawfully restraining them. That apprehension solidified and danger became even more imminent when they managed to successfully snatch the weapons and thereafter fire in the air indicating not only their ability to use the firearm but also their intention of using it to effect their escape against anybody who would have tried to prevent it including the police who were bound by law to do so. 

The right, with respect to the body of any member of the public in the area where the encounter happened, commenced when the accused, desperate to do whatever it takes against any odds, which has already been made clear by their act of snatching weapons despite the odds of number (being worse than 1 against 2) being against them, jumped out of the van, out of physical reach of the police officers, thereby severely curtailing their ability to regain control of their weapons and control the dangerous situation. 

The situation became even more alarming and the danger of grievous hurt and even of death to an innocent by-stander became even more immediate when they fired the weapon, demonstrating their ability and their will to use it to help them escape. 

This danger would have continued as long as the group continued to possess these lethal weapons while trying to flee.

**Section 100 of the Penal Code** specifies when the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death and states:

*The right of private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:—*

*First.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will otherwise be the consequence of such assault;*

*Secondly.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such assault;*

**Section 350 of the Penal Code** deals with the concept of Criminal force and states:

*Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person's consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other.*

**Section 351 of the Penal Code** deals with the concept of assault and states:

*Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.*

The scuffle and the resulting snatching of the weapons from the police officers was enough to cause the policemen to apprehend that the accused were intending to use criminal and lethal force against them to prevent them from discharging their duties. The act of firing the weapon further strengthened that apprehension. Thus this was an assault on the police officers which caused reasonable apprehension of death, or at least grievous hurt, by the use of such lethal weapons.

Firing in the air would have also caused apprehension in the minds of the members of the general public present at the encounter scene that criminal force may be used against any one of them. Thus, the act will be an assault on members of the public to that extent.

Since their acts caused a reasonable apprehension of death and grievous hurt to the police officers and to the members of the immediate public, the police officers right to private defence extended to causing death or any other harm to the fleeing accused.

Since the accused had jumped out of the van and were already out of the physical reach of the police with lethal weapons, in their possession, the only way to stop them, without getting grievously injured due to gunfire and to stop them as soon as possible, before the lethal weapons could find an innocent victim, was to shoot them. That is what was done by the police and their act would hence be justified for not only being an act done in the line of duty but also an act done in exercise of the right to private defence under the provisions herein considered. 

The Police officers thus committed no offence and in the face of a dangerous situation that arose before them acted valiantly to protect the public and uphold the rule of law. 

### Whether the decision of the Hon’ble High Court of Paschim Pradesh needs to be upheld?

It is alleged by the families that the police encounter was stage managed and fake. For a police encounter to be fake, the prime requirement would have been avoiding witnesses at all cost. However, according to facts of the case, the police van carrying the accused, was on its way to the Court to present them before the Magistrate. The Courts are generally located in built up areas where the population density is definitely not scanty. The police encounter, which happened on the way to the court, would have very likely happened in an area that wasn’t completely secluded as opposed to what is ideally required for an encounter to be staged. Hence to say, based on the facts, that the encounter, was staged, would be very illogical. 

The behaviour of the accused on the day of the encounter also needs attention. They were being taken to the court where they could have tried to obtain bail on the merits of the case. However, the fact that they tried to desperately flee, fighting against all odds, by doing whatever they could, was a direct admission of their guilt- because flight is considered to be an admission of guilt. Why would a person, who is not guilty, adopt such means to affect his escape? The only logical answer is that a person would not do so, unless they know they have committed a very serious offence and that the evidence against them is so strong that they will be convicted for sure and would be given the maximum possible punishment. It is only then that such desperation would arise in them to escape when there is still a chance and in this desperation they would not have hesitated to commit another grave crime. To stop such a deadly enemy who, in his mind, has nothing to lose if he fails but a lot to gain if he manages to successfully escape, would require immense bravery on part of anyone who tried to stop them. This is exactly what the Hon’ble High Court held after hearing all the facts and arguments pertaining to the case.  The decision of the Hon’ble High Court is absolutely sound and therefore needs to be upheld. 

## Prayer

It is therefore prayed that the petition filed by the NGO and the petitions filed by the families of the four deceased may be dismissed and accordingly the decision of the Hon’ble High Court of Paschim Pradesh may be upheld.
