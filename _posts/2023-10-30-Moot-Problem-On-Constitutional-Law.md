# Moot Problem On Constitutional Law

Republic of Bharati is a country which has various cultural and historical glories to its name. 
People from various backgrounds lived in harmony and abided by the laws of the land. Majority 
of the population worshipped deities personifying women as a symbol of Strength and 
Fearlessness. Paschim Pradesh is a State of Republic of Bharati with a good literacy rate and 
the people believed in the Equality between Men and Women in all spheres of life. 

Ira was a young Advocate who had just passed her college and started practicing. She was very 
ambitious about her work and always worked for the poor and needy people free of cost. She 
was always the last one to leave her workplace and often took her personal vehicle to travel 
home from workplace. One such night, on 01-09-2023 around 9:30 P.M. she was returning 
from workplace on her scooty, where she noticed four men desperately asking for help beside 
the highway. Out of generosity, she stopped her scooty and two men told her that they are 
tourists and one of their friends is laying injured at a distance. While she got down from her 
scooty, two of them accompanied her to a distant secluded place. 

On her way, she realized that her phone was inside the scooty, so she returned for taking the 
same and on return, she found that her two-wheeler tyre was punctured. Ira called her younger 
sister Arna at 9.35 p.m. to inform that her scooter had broken down and she was alone on the 
road. All of a sudden, the two men, who had asked for help accompanied by two other men 
came towards her and started touching her in a wrong way. She got scared and slapped one of 
them, to which the men became angry and then dragged the girl to a distant place and raped 
her one by one. In the fear of not getting caught, the four men put petroleum on her body and 
burnt her alive till she was dead and ran away towards the nearby village. 

On 08-09-2023 the partially burnt body was found at an underpass on the Paschim national 
highway by a farmer around 6 a.m. He informed the village sarpanch, who alerted the local 
police. After confirming that the victim was a female, the local police verified the recent 
women missing cases and then, with the help of the handbag and the scarf, the family members 
were able to recognise her.

The Police started various investigation procedures and discovered a CCTV footage which was 
placed near the highway for traffic control. By looking at the CCTV footage, the Police saw 
some faces where the recording timing showed around 10:00 P.M. based on which, they started 
searching for the four men who had run towards the village and started the enquiry. On 20-09-2023, based on its investigation, the Police arrested, Manas, Raju, Naval and Keshav. In the 
meantime, as soon as the news became viral, people all over the country started protesting and 
the news became trending all over social media and people demanded Justice for Ira. People 
from various political background as well as Film Industry and Media houses demanded speedy 
Justice and #KillTheRapists became viral all over the Country and the Government took 
initiative for a speedy disposal of the case.  

On 24-09-2023, the Police presented the four accused in front of the local Magistrate and 
requested for a 7 days remand for further investigation. Amidst the remand period, the entire 
Country protested with candle light marches and various High-Profile Personalities also got 
involved in the protests. On 03-10-2023, the Media flashed the news that the four accused had 
been shot dead by the Police while they were being taken to the Court. The Investigation In
Charge in the Interview stated that Naval and Keshav snatched the revolvers from the 
Constables while they were being taken to the Court, jumped out of the Police Van and fired 
two rounds in the air. Manas and Raju also followed them and tried to escape. The Police 
claimed that they found no other ways and had to shoot down the four accused otherwise the 
accused would have fled.

The killing of the accused in the alleged encounter  was  hailed  by  a  section  of  people, the  
families  of  the  deceased  and  human  rights  groups  alleged  that  the  police  took  law  into  
its hands, terming  this as extra-judicial killing. In the police press  conference  that  followed,  
questions  as  to  how  two  of  the  four  accused managed to  get hold of the  pistols in the 
presence  of 10  armed police  officers went unasked.

The families of the Four Accused also alleged that the police officers have framed the murder 
scene as they had threatened them when they went to the police station. The families informed 
the reporters that the police officers angrily made the statement to the families that the accused 
stand no chance of being saved from death as the entire Nation was against their act. 

 As soon as the News became viral, the entire Country rejoiced and supported the action of the 
Police and the same was called an “Act of Bravery” by various Political Leaders. But an NGO 
named as “Nagarik Suraksha” filed a Petition before the Hon’ble High Court of Paschim 
Pradesh. The Hon’ble High Court of Paschim Pradesh after hearing all the arguments of the 
case held “The Police had no other option but to shoot the four accused failing to which they 
would have fled and which would have triggered mass and widespread agitation throughout 
the Nation and the Role of the Police would have been in question. Therefore, the Court finds the Act of the Police as an Act of Bravery and sudden reflex to counter the situation which 
arose in front of them.” 

Families  of  the  four  accused who  were  gunned  down  by the  police  in  an  alleged  
encounter,  have  approached  the  Supreme  Court, seeking  registration  of  murder  case  
against  the  police  officers  involved.  Alleging  that  the youth  were  killed  in  a  stage
managed  gunfight,  the  families  filed  a  writ  petition  under  the provisions  of  Article  32  
of  the  Constitution  that  enables  individuals  to  seek  redressal  for  the violation of  their  
fundamental rights. 

The NGO, after the Judgment by the Hon’ble High Court, approached the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court on the contention of violation of Human Rights as well as the violation of Fundamental 
Rights guaranteed under the Constitution of Republic of Bharati. All the petitions have been 
clubbed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Republic of Bharati and stands pending before the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Republic of Bharati. 

Note: 
   1. The laws of the State of Republic of Bharati are in Pari materia with the laws of India.

## Summary of Arguments 

### Is the petition of the NGO maintainable in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Republic of Bharati? 

That since the conditions specified under Articles 32, 132, 133, 134, 134A and 136 are not met, the petition of the NGO should be dismissed *in limine* .

### Were Fundamental Rights given under Article 21 and Article 22 of the Constitution violated on the issues of custody and did it render subsequent custody illegal?

That as the facts are silent on this, considering that the judicial mind (at two levels: at magistrate level and then at a much higher level in the Hon’ble High Court) applied to all the facts and arguments of this case, did not specifically point out any such lacunae, if a presumption is to be made, it would tilt in favour of the view that conditions relating to production before magistrate within 24 hours of arrest and subsequent remand were fully met. Therefore, there was no violation of Fundamental Rights specified under Article 21 and 22 of the Constitution.

### Whether a person, arrested by the Police, has a right to escape from police custody if the Police continues to detain him beyond the period authorised by law?

That there is no right given to the accused to walk free on their own after their period of detention, as authorised by law, comes to an end. The remedy provided for such matters is only to approach a Court of law to seek bail. The act of snatching weapons from the police and trying to flee is grossly illegal. 

### Whether there was a violation of any Human Rights or Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, of the deceased, with respect to the Police Encounter?  

That there was no violation of Human Rights and Article 21 of the Constitution which guarantees right to life as a Fundamental Right, as the act of the policemen, which resulted in the death of the 4 accused, was not arbitrary and also strictly in accordance to the procedure established by law namely sections 41 and 46 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973.

### Did the encounter of the accused by the Police constitute a murder?

That Police were acting according to section 23 of the Police Act, 1861 and also in exercise of the right to private defence of body. Hence their act would not be a crime as it would be covered under sections 96, 97, 100 and 102 of the Penal Code, 1860.

### Whether the decision of the Hon’ble High Court of Paschim Pradesh needs to be upheld?

That the Hon’ble High Court’s decision is a sound decision based on impeccable logic and proper appreciation of the law and facts and should therefore be upheld.

## Arguments Advanced 

### Is the petition of the NGO maintainable in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Republic of Bharati? 

The NGO has approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Republic of Bharati contending violation of Human Rights and Fundamental Rights guaranteed under the Constitution. They have. 

It is not clear as to under what provisions the NGO has approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court. However, there are the following provisions under which the NGO could have approached the Hon’ble Court. These are considered in seriatim:

   1. Article 132 of the Constitution:

   (1)	An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree or final order of a High Court in the territory of India, whether in a civil, criminal or other proceeding, if the High Court certifies under article 134A that the case involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution.

   (3)	Where such a certificate is given, any party in the case may appeal to the Supreme Court on the ground that any such question as aforesaid has been wrongly decided

   Article 134A of the Constitution: 
   
   Every High Court, passing or making a judgment, decree, final order, or sentence, referred to in clause (1) of article 132 or clause (1) of article 133, or clause (1) of article 134,-
   
   (a) may, if it deems fit so to do, on its own motion; and 
   
   (b) shall, if an oral application is made, by or on behalf of the party aggrieved, immediately after the passing or making of such judgment, decree, final order or sentence, 

   determine, as soon as may be after such passing or making, the question whether a certificate of the nature referred to in clause (1) of article 132, or clause (1) of article 133 or, as the case may be, sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of article 134, may be given in respect of that case.

The NGO could not have approached The Hon’ble Supreme Court under Article 132 as the condition precedent for coming under Article 132 is the issuance of a certificate by the Hon’ble High Court. The facts do not show that any such certificate was issued by the Hon’ble High Court.
