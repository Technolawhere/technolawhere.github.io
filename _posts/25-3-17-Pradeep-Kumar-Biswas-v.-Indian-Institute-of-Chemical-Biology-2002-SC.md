# Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (2002) 5 SCC 111

Judges: SP Bharucha, CJ and Syed Shah Mohammed Quadri, RC Lahoti, N Santosh Hegde, Doraiswamy Raju, Ruma Pal and Arijit Pasayat, JJ

## Facts

In the **1970s, Sabhajit Tewary**, an employee of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), filed a writ petition seeking parity of remuneration. The matter reached the Supreme Court, where a **five-judge bench ruled in Sabhajit Tewary v. Union of India (1975) 1 SCC 485** that the writ petition was not maintainable against CSIR, holding that CSIR was not an "authority" under Article 12 of the Constitution. This decision effectively stated that CSIR was not considered a "State" under the definition in Article 12 of the Indian Constitution, and its employees did not have the same constitutional protections afforded to government servants.

Fast forward to 1986, when **Pradeep Kumar Biswas and others**, employees of a CSIR unit, filed a writ petition **challenging the termination of their services**. The Calcutta High Court, in line with the Sabhajit Tewary decision, rejected the writ application, stating that CSIR was not an "authority" under Article 12. The petitioners then filed a special leave petition before the Supreme Court, which referred the matter to a Constitution Bench, believing that the earlier decision in **Sabhajit Tewary needed to be reconsidered** in light of subsequent decisions regarding government-funded institutions and bodies similar to CSIR.

## Legal Question:

The Constitution Bench was tasked with addressing the following primary legal questions:

  1. **Is CSIR a "State"** within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India?
    
  3. **Should the Court reverse the decision in Sabhajit Tewary (1975)**, which had stood for over a quarter of a century?

## Observations of the Court:

### Interpretation of Article 12:

The Court began by considering the **interpretation of Article 12**, which defines "State" as including the Government of India, the Governments of the States, and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. The Court observed that the **definition of "State" under Article 12 is inclusive rather than exhaustive**, meaning that what constitutes "State" can evolve and be clarified by the judiciary over time. The significance of Article 12 lies in ensuring the protection of fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution, particularly against the arbitrary actions of the "State."

The Court elaborated on how the **concept of "State" had evolved over time**. Initially, it was understood narrowly, but later judicial interpretations expanded the definition (Later, it was understood with reference to the remedies available, such as the writ of mandamus for enforcement of statutory or public duties. Statutory corporations with regulations based on statutory powers were considered "State"), including **statutory corporations, government instrumentalities, and public corporations as part of the "State" for purposes of fundamental rights enforcement**. The Court emphasized that the term "State" also referred to **"authorities" other than the Government itself and could include agencies or bodies performing public functions**.

The Court referred to **Rajasthan SEB v. Mohan Lal (1969) 1 SCC 585**, which held that **"other authorities" in Article 12 include all constitutional or statutory authorities with powers conferred by law, irrespective of whether some powers are for commercial activities**. Similarly, in **Praga Tools Corpn. v. C.A. Imanual AIR 1967 SC 1857**, it was noted that **private companies not engaged in public functions were not considered "State."** 

  >
  >(company incorporated under the Companies Act is not formed statutorily and is not subject to any statutory duty vis-à-vis an individual, it was excluded from the purview of “State”: "the question was whether an application under Article 226 for issuance of a writ of
mandamus would lie impugning an agreement arrived at between a company and its
workmen, the Court held that:
  >19
  >
  >“[T]here was neither a statutory nor a public duty imposed on it by a statute in
respect of which enforcement could be sought by means of a mandamus, nor was
there in its workmen any corresponding legal right for enforcement of any such
statutory or public duty. The High Court, therefore, was right in holding that no writ
petition for a mandamus or an order in the nature of mandamus could lie against the
company")

### Evolving Concept of "State" and the Role of Instrumentality or Agency:

The Court observed that the understanding of "State" under Article 12 had significantly evolved over the years, especially after decisions in **Sukhdev Singh v. Bhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi [(1975) 1 SCC 421]**, which treated public corporations set up by statutes as "authorities" under Article 12. The Court explained that the State often acts through instrumentalities or agencies, and the **key question is whether these entities are performing functions that are public in nature or essential to governance**.

Mathew, J.'s concurring opinion in Sukhdev Singh laid down important tests to identify government instrumentalities, such as the extent of financial control, the nature of the functions performed, and whether the entity’s activities are for public benefit. These tests would later form the basis for decisions on whether various bodies could be treated as "State" under Article 12.

> A State is an abstract entity. It can only act through the instrumentality or
agency of natural or juridical persons. Therefore, there is nothing strange in the
notion of the State acting through a corporation and making it an agency or
instrumentality of the State.”
> 
> 17. For identifying such an agency or instrumentality he propounded four indicia:
>    
> (1) “A finding of the State financial support plus an unusual degree of control over
the management and policies might lead one to characterize an operation as State action.”
>
> (2) “Another factor which might be considered is whether the operation is an
important public function.”
>
> (3) “The combination of State aid and the furnishing of an important public service
may result in a conclusion that the operation should be classified as a State agency. If a
given function is of such public importance and so closely related to governmental
functions as to be classified as a governmental agency, then even the presence or absence
of State financial aid might be irrelevant in making a finding of State action. If the
function does not fall within such a description, then mere addition of State money would
not influence the conclusion.”
>
> (4) “The ultimate question which is relevant for our purpose is whether such a
corporation is an agency or instrumentality of the Government for carrying on a
business for the benefit of the public. In other words, **the question is, for whose
benefit was the corporation carrying on the business?**”  

### Analysis of the Sabhajit Tewary Case:

The Court reviewed the Sabhajit Tewary decision, which had dismissed the writ petition against CSIR by concluding that it was not a "State" under Article 12. The Court **criticized the earlier judgment for two primary reasons**: first, it had disregarded the nature of CSIR as a government-supported entity performing functions that were deeply connected with public policy; second, it failed to consider the evolving nature of what constitutes "State" in judicial interpretation. The earlier judgment had been based on two incorrect premises:

  * **CSIR as a Society Without Statutory Character**: The Sabhajit Tewary decision had focused on the fact that CSIR was a registered society and thus not a "State." However, the Court found this argument irrelevant because being a society did not disqualify CSIR from being considered a "State" if it met the criteria of government control and public function.
  
  * **Decision in Praga Tools:** The reliance on the decision in Praga Tools, which dealt with a private company, was also found misplaced. Decisions regarding companies incorporated under the Companies Act (like Praga Tools) held that their employees did not have the protection of government servants under Article 311 and this reasoning was found to be flawed by the court. It was held that the meaning of state u/a 12 could not be extended to provisions beyond part III and IV of the Constitution.

>
>  With respect, we are of the view that both the premises were not really relevant and in
fact contrary to the “voice and hands” approach in Sukhdev Singh. Besides reliance by the
Court on decisions pertaining to Article 311 which is contained in Part XIV of the
Constitution was inapposite. What was under consideration was Article 12 which by
definition is limited to Part III and by virtue of Article 36 to Part IV of the Constitution. As
said by another Constitution Bench later in this context:
>
>21. “[M]erely because a juristic entity may be an ‘authority’ and therefore ‘State’
within the meaning of Article 12, it may not be elevated to the position of ‘State’ for
the purpose of Articles 309, 310 and 311 which find a place in Part XIV. The
definition of ‘State’ in Article 12 which includes an ‘authority’ within the territory of
India or under the control of the Government of India is limited in its application
only to Part III and by virtue of Article 36, to Part IV: it does not extend to the other
provisions of the Constitution and hence a juristic entity which may be ‘State’ for the
purpose of Parts III and IV would not be so for the purpose of Part XIV or any other
provision of the Constitution. This is why the decisions of this Court in S.L. Agarwal
v. Hindustan Steel Ltd and other cases involving the applicability of Article 311
have no relevance to the issue before us.”

  
### Subsequent Developments and Tests for "State":

The Court further analyzed key decisions such as **Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India [(1979) 3 SCC 489]**, which had expanded the scope of "State" by treating government-controlled public corporations as part of the "State" under Article 12. The Court referred to the test laid out in Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi [(1981) 1 SCC 722], which further broadened the definition of "State" by providing a set of criteria for determining whether a body is a government instrumentality or agency. These tests included:
  
  * Whether the government holds the entire share capital of the body.
  *
  * Whether the body is predominantly funded by the government.
  *
  * Whether the body has been created to perform a governmental function or serve a public purpose.
  *
  * Whether the government exercises significant control over the body.

**Som Prakash Rekhi v. Union of India**, decided on the same day as Ajay Hasia, followed Ramana and held **Bharat Petroleum Corporation to be "State"** under the enlarged meaning of Article 12, criticizing and distinguishing Sabhajit Tewary. The tests from Ramana and Ajay Hasia form the keystone of subsequent jurisprudence on Article 12. Cases like **P.K. Ramachandra Iyer v. Union of India [(1984) 2 SCC 141] (regarding ICAR and the Indian Veterinary Research Institute)** and **B.S. Minhas v. Indian Statistical Institute [(1983) 4 SCC 582] (regarding the Indian Statistical Institute)** further eroded the authority of Sabhajit Tewary by holding similar registered societies to be "State" based on government control and funding.

### Summarised Test given by the Court

>
> The picture that ultimately emerges is that the tests formulated in Ajay Hasia are **not a
rigid set of principles** so that if a body falls within any one of them it must, ex hypothesi, be
considered to be a State within the meaning of Article 12. The question in each case would be
> whether in the light of the cumulative facts as established, the body is
>
> financially,
>
> functionally
>
> and administratively dominated by or under the control of the Government.
>
> Such control must be particular to the body in question and must be pervasive.
>
> If this is found then the body is a State within Article 12.
>
> On the other hand, when the control is merely regulatory whether under statute or otherwise, it would not serve to make the body a State.
>

### Application of Tests to CSIR:

In applying these tests to CSIR, the Court noted that:

* **Creation and Purpose:** CSIR was created by the Government of India in 1942 to carry out functions previously performed by a government department. Its objectives, which included fostering industrial and scientific research, were essential to the government's welfare and public policy.

* **Control and Management:** CSIR was governed by a body that was heavily influenced by the government. The President of the Governing Body was the Prime Minister, demonstrating the government's dominant role in the institution's functioning.

* **Financial Control:** CSIR's funding was predominantly from the government, with over 70% of its funds coming from government grants. Additionally, CSIR was required to follow government budgetary guidelines, and its accounts were audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

* **Regulatory and Functional Control:** CSIR was subject to government regulations regarding personnel and financial management. The Court found that these factors strongly indicated that CSIR was under the control of the government in both financial and administrative matters.

### Reversal of Sabhajit Tewary:

The Court concluded that the Sabhajit Tewary decision was incorrect and needed to be overturned. It emphasized that the principles underlying Sabhajit Tewary were flawed, particularly in light of the evolving judicial interpretation of "State" under Article 12. The Court further noted that the 1986 notification under the Administrative Tribunals Act, which identified CSIR as a government-owned and controlled body, was a critical development in understanding CSIR's status as a "State."

## Decision of the Court:

The Supreme Court held that:

* CSIR is a "State" under Article 12 of the Constitution.
*
* The decision in Sabhajit Tewary v. Union of India is overruled.
*
* The matter was remitted back to the appropriate bench for further adjudication in light of the present decision.
