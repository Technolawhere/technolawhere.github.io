# Duncans Industries Ltd. v. State of U.P. (2000) 1 SCC 633

JUDGE: N. SANTOSH HEGDE

Gist: To determine if a machinery embedded in earth is to be considered as immovable or movable property, one needs to consider the intention of both the party that embedded the said machinery and the party that intends to alienate it. 

>"The Court considering the said question will have to take into consideration the intention of the parties which embedded the machinery and also the intention of the parties who intend alienating that machinery."

## Facts

* A company agreed to transfer its fertilizer business to the appellant on an “as is where is” basis and “as a going concern” ("going concern" is an accounting term used to describe a company that is financially stable enough to meet its obligations and continue its business for the foreseeable future. It is assumed that a business considered to be "a going concern" is expected to stay in business, at least for now.)

* The term “fertilizer business” was defined to mean and include the following other properties:

   * Demised land plots together with the building and structures thereon.
 
   * Freehold land and residential buildings thereon.
 
   * **Plant and machinery** relating to the fertilizer business including the ammonia manufacturing plants, the captive power plant and all other moveable capital assets including vehicles, furniture, air conditioners, standby systems, pipelines, railway siding etc., as on the transfer date and wheresoever situate, all of which relate exclusively to the fertilizer business and are owned and in the possession of ICI (The company that sold its business to the appellant) or are owned by ICI but in the lawful possession of any third party for and on behalf of ICI.

* Plant and the machinery were treated to be immovable property and its value was included while calculating the value of the property transferred under the conveyance deed. This was what gave rise to the appeal before the Court.

## Issue

* Whether the plant and machinery in the instant case can be construed
as immovable property or not.

## Observations of the Court and Decision

* Court upheld the decision of the High Court.

* High Court had reasoned that as these machineries were permanently embedded in the earth with the intention of running the fertilizer factory, and while embedding the said machineries, the intention was not to remove the same either for the purpose of sale of parts or as scrap, they should be considered as immovable property. It had relied on **Reynolds v. Ashby & Son 1904 AC 466** and **Official Liquidator v. Sri Krishna Deo AIR 1959 All 247** to come to this conclusion.

* Further said that the following things need to be considered:

   * Facts and circumstances of each case
 
      * APPLICATION: Considering the description of the machineries in the agreement, the nature of agreement, etc, it is clear that "the machineries which have been embedded in the earth to constitute a fertilizer plant in the instant case, are definitely embedded permanently with a view to utilise the same as a fertilizer plant." 
 
   * Intention of the parties when they decided to embed the machinery
 
      * APPLICATION: "The description of the machines as seen in the schedule attached to the deed of conveyance also shows without any doubt that they were set up permanently in the land in question with a view to operate a fertilizer plant and the same was not embedded to dismantle and remove the same for the purpose of sale as machinery at any point of time."
 
   * Whether such embedment was intended to be temporary or permanent
 
   * APPLICATION: permanent, as construed from above.

* The appellant, while contending that the machinery was movable property, had relied on the decision of **Sirpur Paper Mills Ltd. v. CCE (1998) 1 SCC 400** which had concluded that the embedded machinery in a paper mill was movable property. The SC however said that that decision was based on the facts and circumstances of that case and were different from the present case and hence would not support his case. The court has declared those machineries as movables based on the fact that the machineries had been attached to the ground only for operational efficiency and if the appellant wanted to sell the paper-making machine it could always remove it from its base and sell it.

* DECISION: The plant and machineries were thus held to be immovable properties given the facts and circumstances of the case and the intention of the parties involved in the agreement.
