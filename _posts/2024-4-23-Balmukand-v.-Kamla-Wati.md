# Balmukand v. KamlaWati (1964) 6 SCR 321, AIR 1964 SC 1385

Judge: J. B. MUDHOLKAR

## Facts

* Plaintiff purchased 23/120th share in this land belonging to one Devisahai, becoming owner of 17/20th share in this land. Plaintiff paid Rs 175 per marla.
  
* Remaining 3/20th share belongs to the joint Hindu family, Pindidas being the Manager.
  
* In order to consolidate his holding, the plaintiff desired to acquire the 3/20th share held by the joint family of Pindidas and his brothers.
  
* Pindidas agreed to sell the remaining share for Rs 250 per marla.
  
* Manager failed to execute the sale deed causing the plaintiff to institute the suit which manager and his brothers defended.
  
* Lower courts held that the contract was not binding on the family as there was no necessity nor benefit involved.


## Issues

* Whether the intended sale was beneficial to the family inasmuch as it was not a practical proposition for the defendants to make any use of their fractional share in the land and, therefore, by converting it into money the family stood to gain?

* Whether family has power to sell the family property not only for a defensive purpose but also where circumstances are such that a prudent owner of property would alienate it for a consideration which he regards to be adequate?

## Observations of the Court and Decision 

* In *Jagatnarain v. Mathura Das (ILR 50 All 969)* the meaning and implication of the term "Benefit of the estate" was examined and it was held that transactions justifiable on the principle of benefit to the estate are not limited to those which are of a defensive nature. Moreover, degree of prudence required from the Manager would be a little greater than that expected of a sole owner of property. 

   * The court held  that for a transaction to be regarded as one which is of benefit to the family it need not necessarily be only of a defensive character. But what transaction would be for the benefit of the family must necessarily depend upon the facts of such case.

   * Alienation can be done for non-defensive purposes when:
   1. It has become difficult to manage the property
   2. Family is incurring losses due to difficulties in managing the property.
   3. Alienation is done with the idea to invest the proceeds in some profitable manner.

* In the present case there is nothing in the plaint to suggest that Pindidas agreed to sell the property because he found it difficult to manage it or because he found that the family was incurring loss by retaining the property. Nor is there anything to suggest that the idea was to invest the sale proceeds in some profitable manner. All that is said is that the fraction of the family’s share of the land owned by the family bore a very small proportion to the land which the plaintiff held at the date of the transaction. Nothing to indicate that the position of the family vis- a-vis their share in the land had in any way been altered by reason of the circumstance that the remaining 17/20th interest in the land came to be owned by the plaintiff alone. Thus plaintiff cannot succeed if the view of the Allahbad HC is to be followed.

* In *Sital Prasad Singh v. Ajablal Mander (ILR 18 Pat 306)*
  
   * *Test to determine the power of a manager to alienate part of the joint family property for the acquisition of new property* was held to be whether the transaction was one into which a prudent owner would enter in the ordinary course of management in order to benefit the estate. Thus the only reasonable limit on the power was to *act prudently*, i.e. to act with foresight, without haste, recklessness and arbitrariness.
     
  * It was further held that expression *“benefit of the estate” has a wider meaning* than mere compelling necessity and is not limited to transactions of a purely defensive nature. Court also observed that transaction entered into by a manager *should not be of a speculative nature*.
    
  * Further the court said that under certain *exceptional circumstances*, court will uphold the alienation of a part of the joint family property by a karta for the acquisition of new property, for e.g., where *all the adult members of the joint family* with the knowledge available to them and possessing all the necessary information about the means and requirement of the family are convinced that the proposed purchase of the new property is for the benefit of the estate.

* In the present case there is no suggestion that they agreed to the transaction or were consulted about it or even knew of the transaction.

* In *A.T. Vasudevan (AIR 1949 Mad 260)* it was held that manager of joint Hindu family is competent to alienate joint family property if it is clearly beneficial to the estate even though there is no legal necessity justifying the transaction.

* Thus in each case the court must be satisfied from the material before it that it was in fact such as conferred or was reasonably expected to confer benefit on the family at the time it was entered into.

* But in the present case not even an allegation in the plaint that the transaction was such as was regarded as beneficial to the family when it was entered into by Pindidas. Adult members of the family have stoutly resisted. There have been no consultations.

* Thus, the courts below were right in dismissing the suit for specific performance. It is also to be noted that granting specific performance is always in the discretion of the court and in our view in a case of this kind the court would be exercising its discretion right by refusing specific performance.
