# LALITA KUMARI v GOVT. OF U.P. 2008 (11) SCALE 154

Judge: B.N. AGRAWAL AND G.S. SINGHVI, JJ. 

## Issue

This case concerns the issue of non registration of FIR and non commencement of investigation in some cases where FIR has been registered. 

## Observations of the Court

* Court observed that experience shows that even after orders are passed by the concerned courts for registration of the case, the police does not take necessary steps until harsh orders are passed by the Court. On the flip side, there are innumerable instances where the complainant is a practical person, FIRs are registered immediately, copies thereof are made over to the complainant on the same day and investigation proceeds swiftly.

* Observing this, the court felt it was appropriate for it to give directions to the Government of all the States and UTs and Director Generals of Police/Commissioners of Police to the effect
   
   * That if steps are not taken for registration of FIRs immediately and copies thereof are not handed over to the complainants, they may move the Magistrates concerned by filing complaint petitions for appropriate direction(s) to the police to register the case immediately and for apprehending the accused persons.

   * Failing which, contempt proceedings must be initiated against those police officers failing in performing these duties and for which they cannot provide any sufficient cause.
