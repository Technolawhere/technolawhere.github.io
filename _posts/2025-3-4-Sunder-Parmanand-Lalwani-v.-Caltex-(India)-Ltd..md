# Sunder Parmanand Lalwani v. Caltex (India) Ltd. AIR 1969 Bom 2

## Facts:

*   Sunder Parmanand Lalwani, operating as Lalwani Brothers, sought to register the trademark "Caltex" for horological and chronometric instruments under Class 14, claiming use since 1955.
  
*   Caltex (India) Limited opposed this registration. They asserted their proprietorship of the "Caltex" mark in Class 4 and Class 19, with continuous usage in India dating back to 1937. Caltex (India) Ltd. argued that Lalwani's proposed trademark would likely deceive or cause confusion in the trade.

*   Caltex (India) Ltd. had been using the trade mark "Caltex" since 1937 on a large scale for industrial oils and greases, lubricants, fuels (including motor spirit), illuminants (including kerosene), asphalt, pitch, bitumen, and building materials. The company demonstrated substantial annual turnover and significant advertisement costs.

*   The Deputy Registrar initially dismissed the opposition filed by Caltex (India) Ltd.  However, Justice S. M. Shah reversed this decision, which led to the current appeal.

## Legal Questions and Answers:

*   **Central Legal Question:** Could Lalwani register the "Caltex" trademark for watches, given Caltex (India) Ltd.'s existing registration and established use of the same mark for petroleum products?

     *   **Answer:** The court ruled against Lalwani, stating that **registering the mark would likely cause deception and confusion**, thus contravening Section 11(a) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958.

*   **Subsidiary Questions and Answers:**

    *   **Was there a tangible danger of confusion between "Caltex" watches and "Caltex" petroleum products?**

        *   **Answer:** Yes, the court found that the extensive use and strong reputation of the "Caltex" mark by Caltex (India) Ltd. made it likely that the public would be deceived or confused if Lalwani's registration were granted.

    *   **Did dishonesty factor into Lalwani's adoption of the "Caltex" trademark for watches?**

        *   **Answer:** Yes, the court found that Lalwani acted dishonestly in selecting the mark "Caltex", with the intention of trading on the wide reputation that the mark enjoys in India.

    *   **Was Lalwani the rightful proprietor of the mark in India for watches, either independently or as an importer?**

        *   **Answer:** The court held that although Lalwani was the originator of the "Caltex" mark for watches in India, this did not override the likelihood of deception and confusion.

    *   **To what extent should the court interfere with the Deputy Registrar's discretion to register the applicant's mark?**

        *   **Answer:** The court decided that the Deputy Registrar had erred in exercising discretion to allow registration, and Justice Shah was justified in reversing that decision. The Deputy Registrar did not appreciate all the relevant facts when considering the grounds for refusal of registration.

## Contentions:

*   **Applicant (Lalwani):**
  
    *   Lalwani contended that there would be no confusion because the goods for which the trademark was registered were different.

    *   He stated that the "Caltex" trademark was already registered in Switzerland for Class 14 goods.

    *   Lalwani claimed continuous use of the mark in India since 1955.

    *   He argued that he was the rightful proprietor of the mark in India.

    *   Lalwani asserted entitlement to the trademark as an importer's mark.

*   **Opponent (Caltex (India) Ltd.):**

    *   Caltex (India) Ltd. asserted their proprietorship of the mark in Class 4 and Class 19.

    *   They cited continuous use of the mark in India since 1937, supported by extensive publicity.

    *   The company argued that the applicant's mark was identical and likely to deceive or cause confusion.

    *   Caltex (India) Ltd. claimed that registration should be denied due to the likelihood of deception, confusion, and the applicant's allegedly dishonest intention.

    *   They disputed Lalwani's claim to proprietorship of the "Caltex" trademark.

    *   Caltex (India) Ltd. maintained that there was a likelihood of deception and confusion.

## Observations:

*   The court observed that Caltex (India) Ltd. had been a registered proprietor of the "Caltex" mark for goods in Classes 4 and 19 since 1943, with significant business and advertising activities in India.

*   The court scrutinized Lalwani's evidence of mark usage and found it unconvincing, citing limited proof of actual imports and sales of "Caltex" watches.

*   The court noted the falsity of Lalwani's claim regarding the propaganda, campaign, and advertisement of the "Caltex" mark for his watches.

*   The court determined that Lalwani originated the "Caltex" mark for watches in India, as Degoumois & Co. had disclaimed any interest in the proprietorship of that mark for watches in India.

*   The court emphasized that **the burden of proof lies on the applicant to demonstrate that the mark is not likely to deceive or cause confusion**.

*   The court found that the extensive use and strong reputation of the "Caltex" mark by the opponents made it likely that the public would be deceived or confused if the applicant's registration were granted.

*   The court noted the applicant's lack of explanation for selecting the word "Caltex" and inferred that the selection was made to capitalize on the reputation of the mark as used by the opponents.

*   The court found that the applicant acted dishonestly in selecting the mark "Caltex", with the intention of trading on the wide reputation which that mark enjoys in India.

## Provisions of Law:

*   **Section 11(a) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958**: This provision states that a mark cannot be registered if its use is likely to deceive or cause confusion.

*   **Section 11(e) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958**: The provision contained in clause (e) is discretionary and is to be considered in cases when an application is made for registration.

*   **Section 18(4) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958**: This section grants the Registrar discretion to accept or refuse an application for registration. The Registrar may refuse the application or accept it with conditions or limitations.

## Decision:

*   The court dismissed Lalwani's appeal.

*   It was held that Lalwani had dishonestly selected the mark. Given this dishonest intention, the Deputy Registrar was deemed incorrect in exercising discretion in favor of Lalwani; the Deputy Registrar should have refused registration.

*   **The court upheld the finding that registering the applicant's mark would likely cause deception and confusion, thus contravening Section 11(a) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958**.

*   The court decided that the Deputy Registrar had erred in exercising discretion to allow registration, and Justice Shah was justified in reversing that decision.
