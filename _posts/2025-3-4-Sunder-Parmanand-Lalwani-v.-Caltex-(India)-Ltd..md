# Sunder Parmanand Lalwani v. Caltex (India) Ltd. AIR 1969 Bom 24

## Facts:

*   Sunder Parmanand Lalwani, trading as Lalwani Brothers, applied to register the trademark "Caltex" for horological and chronometric instruments in Class 14, claiming use since 1955.
  
*   Caltex (India) Limited opposed the registration, asserting they were proprietors of the "Caltex" mark in Class 4 and Class 19 since 1937 and that the applicant's mark would cause deception or confusion.
  
*   Caltex (India) Ltd. had been using the trade mark "Caltex" since 1937 on a large scale for industrial oils, greases, lubricants, fuels including kerosene, asphalt and building materials, with substantial annual turnover and advertisement costs.
  
*   The Deputy Registrar initially dismissed Caltex (India) Ltd.'s opposition, but Justice S. M. Shah reversed this decision, leading to the appeal.

## Legal Question:

*   The primary legal question was whether the applicant, Lalwani, could register the "Caltex" trademark for watches, considering Caltex (India) Ltd.'s existing registration and use of the same mark for petroleum products.

*   Subsidiary questions included:
     
     *   Was there a tangible danger of confusion between "Caltex" watches and "Caltex" petroleum products?

     *   Was there dishonesty in Lalwani's adoption of the "Caltex" trademark for watches?
     
     *   Was Lalwani the proprietor of the mark in India for watches, either in his own right or as an importer's mark?

     *   Should the court interfere with the Deputy Registrar's discretion to register the applicant's mark?

## Contentions:

*   **Applicant (Lalwani):**
  
    *   There would be no confusion because the goods were different.

    *   The trademark "Caltex" was already registered in Switzerland for Class 14 goods.

    *   Lalwani had been using the mark in India since 1955.

    *   Lalwani was the proprietor of the mark in India.

    *   Argued that the applicant was entitled to it as an importer's mark.

*   **Opponent (Caltex (India) Ltd.):**

    *   They were the proprietors of the mark in Class 4 and Class 19.
      
    *   They had been using the mark in India since 1937 with wide publicity.
      
    *   The applicant's mark was identical and likely to deceive or cause confusion.
 
    *   Registration should be refused due to the likelihood of deception and confusion and the applicant's dishonest intention.
      
    *   The applicant was not the proprietor of the trademark "Caltex".
  
    *   There was a likelihood of deception and confusion.

## Observations:

*   The court noted that Caltex (India) Ltd. was a registered proprietor of the "Caltex" mark for goods in Classes 4 and 19 since 1943 and had a substantial business and advertising presence in India.
  
*   The court examined the evidence of Lalwani's use of the mark, finding it less than satisfactory, with limited evidence of actual imports and sales of "Caltex" watches.
  
*   The court observed that the applicant's statement about propaganda, campaign and advertisement of the mark "Caltex" in respect of the applicant's watches was not true.
  
*   The court determined that the applicant was the originator of the "Caltex" mark for watches in India, as Degoumois & Co. disclaimed any interest in the proprietorship of that mark for watches etc. in India.
  
*   The court emphasized that the burden of proving that the mark is not calculated to deceive or cause confusion lies on the applicant.
  
*   The court found that due to the opponents' extensive use and reputation of the "Caltex" mark, there was a likelihood of deception and confusion if the applicant's registration was granted.
  
*   The court found the applicant acted dishonestly in selecting the mark "Caltex", with the intention of trading on the wide reputation which that mark enjoys in India.

## Decision:

*   The court dismissed the appeal filed by Lalwani.
  
*   The court agreed with the learned Judge and held that the applicant dishonestly selected the mark, and that in view of the existence of such dishonest intention the Deputy Registrar was wrong in exercising the discretion in favor of the applicant, and that the Deputy Registrar ought to have refused registration on that ground also.
  
*   The court upheld the finding that registering the applicant's mark would likely cause deception and confusion, contravening Section 11(a) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958.
