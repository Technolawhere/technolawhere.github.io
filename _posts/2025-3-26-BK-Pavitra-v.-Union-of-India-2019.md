## Facts:

The case involves a challenge to the constitutional validity of the Karnataka Extension of Consequential Seniority to Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of Reservation (to the Posts in the Civil Services of the State) Act, 2018 (Reservation Act 2018). This Act was enacted after the Supreme Court in B K Pavitra v Union of India (B K Pavitra I) held Sections 3 and 4 of the Karnataka Determination of Seniority of the Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of Reservation (to the Posts in the Civil Services of the State) Act, 2002 (Reservation Act 2002) to be unconstitutional. B K Pavitra I found the 2002 Act invalid because the State of Karnataka had not collected quantifiable data on inadequacy of representation, backwardness, and overall efficiency as mandated by the Supreme Court's decision in M Nagaraj v Union of India.

Following the B K Pavitra I judgment, the Government of Karnataka constituted the Ratna Prabha Committee to collect and analyze data on these three parameters. Based on the Committee's report, the State enacted the Reservation Act 2018. Section 3 of the 2018 Act provides for consequential seniority to government servants belonging to Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) promoted based on reservation. Section 4 protects consequential seniority already accorded from April 27, 1978. The 2018 Act came into force with effect from June 17, 1995. The petitioners challenged the validity of this new Act.

## Legal Questions Before the Court:

The principal legal question before the Court was whether the Karnataka Extension of Consequential Seniority to Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of Reservation Act, 2018 is constitutionally valid. Sub-questions included:

* Whether the 2018 Act peremptorily overrules B K Pavitra I without altering its basis.
  
* Whether it violates the law laid down in M G Badappanavar v State of Karnataka on seniority.
  
* Whether the enactment reveals a manifest intent to overrule B K Pavitra I.
  
* Whether the Governor's reference of the Bill to the President under Article 200 was constitutionally valid.
  
* Whether the 2018 Act complies with the principles in Nagaraj and Jarnail Singh v Lachhmi Narain Gupta.
  
* Whether the Ratna Prabha Committee report provided an adequate and appropriate basis for the Act.
  
* Whether the Act applies to departments with overrepresentation or public corporations not covered by the report.

  
## Contentions of the Plaintiffs:
The petitioners, B K Pavitra and others, contended that the Reservation Act 2018 was enacted merely to overrule the decision in B K Pavitra I without removing its basis, thus amounting to usurpation of judicial power. They argued that the 2018 Act is substantively the same as the 2002 Act, and the only new element is the Ratna Prabha Committee report, which they assailed as flawed and not compliant with the requirements of Nagaraj and Jarnail.
Specifically, they argued:

* The report's data collection was inadequate (only 31 of 62 departments, exclusion of PSUs, vacancy-based data instead of post-based and cadre-based data).
  
* The report failed to adequately demonstrate backwardness (as per Nagaraj) and impact on administrative efficiency.
  
* The Governor's reservation of the Bill for the President's consideration was invalid due to lack of specificity and the State government's own view that it was unnecessary.
  
* The 2018 Act violates the principles of seniority laid down in Badappanavar.
  
* The retrospectivity of the Act from 1978 is arbitrary.
  
* The Act allows for unlimited backlog and creation of supernumerary posts.
  
* The State had not genuinely complied with the directions in B K Pavitra I before enacting the new law.
  
## Contentions of the Respondents:
The respondents, the Union of India and the State of Karnataka, argued that the Reservation Act 2018 is constitutionally valid because it cured the deficiency identified in B K Pavitra I by collecting and analyzing quantifiable data through the Ratna Prabha Committee. They contended that the Act does not overrule the judicial decision but removes its basis.
Their main arguments were:

* The Ratna Prabha Committee report adequately demonstrated inadequacy of representation and no adverse impact on administrative efficiency.
  
* The collection of data based on groups A, B, C, and D was representative of cadres.
* The President's assent to the Bill fulfilled constitutional requirements, and its validity is non-justiciable.
* The Act's retrospectivity is justified and protects consequential seniority already granted, consistent with earlier Supreme Court rulings on the catch-up rule.
* The concept of creamy layer is not applicable to consequential seniority in promotions for SCs and STs.
* The Act aims for substantive equality and is a valid exercise of the enabling power under Article 16(4A).
* Seniority is not a vested right, and the legislature can enact laws dealing with it.
Observations of the Court:
The Supreme Court made the following key observations:
* Curative Legislation: The Court reiterated that the legislature has the power to enact curative legislation to remove the basis of a judicial decision that invalidated a law, and this does not amount to usurpation of judicial power. It distinguished this from simply overruling a judicial decision. The Court found that the Reservation Act 2018 aimed to remedy the deficiency noted in B K Pavitra I by collecting quantifiable data. It distinguished the case from Madan Mohan Pathak v Union of India, where a law sought to override a mandamus.
* Assent to the Bill: The Court held that once the Governor reserved the Bill for the President's consideration and the President assented to it, the requirements of Article 201 were fulfilled, and the validity of the President's assent is non-justiciable. The reasons for the Governor's reservation, even if not explicitly detailed, and the State government's initial view on its necessity do not invalidate the President's assent. The Court relied on Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd v State of Bihar to support the non-justiciability of the President's assent.
* Compliance with Nagaraj and Jarnail: The Court found that following B K Pavitra I, the State government duly carried out the exercise of collating and analyzing data on the compelling factors of inadequacy of representation and impact on efficiency, as clarified by Jarnail (which held that quantifiable data on backwardness is not required for SCs/STs). The Court recognized the limitations of judicial review in scrutinizing the propriety and sufficiency of such data collection and analysis, deferring to the state's opinion based on the expert committee report unless it considered irrelevant material or reached unreasonable conclusions. It upheld the Ratna Prabha Committee's methodology, including the use of representative sampling and data collection based on groups. The Court reiterated the principles from Sabharwal and Nagaraj that reservation percentages are based on cadre strength, not vacancies or filled posts.
* Substantive Equality and Efficiency: The Court emphasized that equality must be substantive, recognizing existing societal inequalities, and reservations are a means to achieve this. It rejected the stereotypical assumption that roster point promotees from SCs/STs are not efficient. The Court adopted an inclusive definition of "efficiency of administration" that includes representation of diverse segments of society. It discussed the concept of meritocracy, stating that "merit" should not be limited to narrow criteria like standardized exams but should encompass the fulfillment of constitutional goals like uplifting marginalized communities and ensuring a diverse administration. The Court noted that promotions are based on seniority-cum-merit, and a statutory period of officiation ensures efficiency is maintained.
* Creamy Layer: The Court held that the concept of creamy layer has no application in assessing the validity of the Reservation Act 2018, which deals with consequential seniority upon promotion, not the initial reservation at the entry level. It cited Jarnail, which clarified that the creamy layer principle applies to persons within SCs/STs who no longer require reservation, not to promotions beyond the entry stage. The Court clarified that Nagaraj did apply the creamy layer test as a facet of the equality principle.
* Retrospectivity: The Court found the provisions regarding retrospectivity in the 2018 Act to be neither arbitrary nor unconstitutional. It noted that the protection of consequential seniority from April 27, 1978, was logical given earlier rulings protecting promotions made before specific dates without following the catch-up rule.
* Overrepresentation: The Court accepted the State's explanation that the data from 31 departments was representative. It noted that overrepresentation in certain posts (like Group D) due to general category candidates not applying cannot be a basis to deny promotions to reserved category employees. It also pointed to the Government Order of 1999 limiting reservation in promotion until representation reaches 15% for SCs and 3% for STs.
Answers to the Contentions of the Two Parties:
* The Court answered the petitioners' contention of usurpation of judicial power by stating that the 2018 Act is a valid exercise of legislative power to remove the basis of the B K Pavitra I decision by collecting and analyzing data, not a mere overruling of the judgment.
* The Court found the Ratna Prabha Committee report to be Nagaraj and Jarnail compliant, holding that the data collection and analysis, while having some limitations, were sufficiently representative and did not rely on irrelevant material or lead to unreasonable conclusions.
* The Court upheld the validity of the President's assent, dismissing the petitioners' arguments regarding the Governor's reference.
* The Court found the retrospectivity of the Act to be valid and logical in the context of existing service jurisprudence and protections.
* The Court held that the creamy layer principle is not applicable to the consequential seniority provisions in the 2018 Act.
* The Court accepted the respondents' arguments that the Act aims for substantive equality and that the data supports the need for consequential seniority to address the inadequacy of representation.
Decision of the Court:
The Supreme Court dismissed the writ petitions, upholding the constitutional validity of the Karnataka Extension of Consequential Seniority to Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of Reservation (to the Posts in the Civil Services of the State) Act, 2018. Consequently, the review petitions and miscellaneous applications were also dismissed. The Court found the Act to be compliant with Nagaraj and Jarnail and a valid exercise of the enabling power under Article 16(4A) of the Constitution.
