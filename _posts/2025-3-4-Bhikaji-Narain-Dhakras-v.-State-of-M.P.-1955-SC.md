# Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. State of M.P. AIR 1955 SC 781

SR Das, CJ and NH Bhagwati, TL Venkatarama Ayyar, Syed JAfer Imam and N Chandrasekhara Aiyar, JJ

## Facts:

*   The petitioners were stage carriage operators who had been conducting their business for a considerable period under permits granted by **Section 58 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939**, as amended by the **C. P. & Berar Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1947**.

*   The **C. P. & Berar Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1947**, brought in extensive changes to the **Motor Vehicles Act, 1939**, in its application to Central Provinces and Berar, empowering the government with considerable authority. These powers encompassed the ability to:

    *   Fix fares

    *   Cancel permits

    *   Engage in road transport business

    *   Limit the duration of licenses

    *   Grant permits to entities with governmental financial interests.

*   The State of Madhya Pradesh possessed a significant portion of the share capital in two motor transport companies: C. P. Transport Services Ltd. and Provincial Transport Co. Ltd. Eventually, the state acquired the complete undertakings of these companies.

*   The government exercised these powers to pursue the nationalization of road transport, which involved limiting the duration of permits and issuing notifications to take over specific routes.

*   The Constitution of India was enforced on January 26, 1950, guaranteeing fundamental rights, including the freedom to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade, or business under **Article 19(1)(g)**.

*   The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, amended **Article 19(6)**, influencing the state's capacity to establish monopolies in particular sectors.

*   The Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, further revised provisions concerning property rights.

*   On May 27, 1955, the petitioners lodged writ petitions contesting the constitutional validity of the **C. P. & Berar Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1947**.

## Legal Questions and Answers:

*   **Central Legal Question:**

    *   Did the **C. P. & Berar Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1947**, become void after the Constitution came into effect on January 26, 1950, due to its inconsistency with **Article 19(1)(g)** of the Constitution, and if so, what was the impact of the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, on the validity of the said Act?

        *   **Answer:** The court ruled that the amending Act became void to the degree of its inconsistency with **Article 19(1)(g)** but was temporarily "eclipsed". The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, eliminated this shadow, reviving the challenged Act and making it enforceable against citizens.

    *   Did the **C. P. & Berar Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1947**, conflict with **Article 31(2)** of the Constitution regarding the deprivation of property, and what was the effect of the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955?

        *   **Answer:** The court recognized the initial inconsistency with **Article 31** but indicated that the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, removed this inconsistency. Consequently, the petitioners could not dispute the Act's constitutionality after April 27, 1955.

*   **Subsidiary Questions and Answers:**

    *   What is the meaning of "void" in **Article 13(1)** of the Constitution with respect to existing laws inconsistent with fundamental rights?

        *   **Answer:** "Void" implies that the existing law became ineffectual and devoid of legal force only to the extent of its inconsistency with the fundamental rights. The law was not entirely obliterated but remained in force for past transactions, non-citizens, and enforcement of rights and liabilities accrued before the Constitution.

    *   Did the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, have a retrospective effect on laws that were inconsistent with the original **Article 19(1)(g)**?

        *   **Answer:** While the amended clause (2) of **Article 19** was expressly made retrospective, clause (6) was not. The challenged Act could not operate against citizens between January 26, 1950, and June 18, 1951. However, after the amendment of clause (6), the Act became fully operative against citizens.

    *   How do American legal precedents regarding unconstitutional laws apply to pre-Constitution laws in India?

        *   **Answer:** The court differentiated between pre-Constitution and post-Constitution laws. American precedents, which deal with laws that never came to life because they were inconsistent with the Constitution from inception, do not fully apply to pre-Constitution laws that were initially valid.

## Contentions:

*   **Petitioners' Contentions:**

    *   The amending Act infringed on their fundamental right under **Article 19(1)(g)** to carry on business and was not a reasonable restriction under **Article 19(6)**.

    *   The amending Act deprived them of their property rights, conflicting with **Article 31(2)** of the Constitution.

    *   The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, and the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, were not retrospective and could not validate the impugned Act.

*   **Respondents' Contentions:**

    *   Even though the amending Act became void on January 26, 1950, due to inconsistency with **Article 19(1)(g)**, the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, removed this inconsistency, making the Act operative again.

    *   The Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, saved the impugned law because it did not provide for the transfer of ownership or right to possession of any property.

## Observations:

*   The court observed that the amending Act conferred extensive powers on the Provincial Government to regulate and control motor transport business, even to the exclusion of private operators.

*   The court noted that the word "void" in **Article 13(1)** means the law is void only to the extent of its inconsistency with fundamental rights and is not entirely obliterated.

*   The court referenced its previous decision in *Keshavan Madhava Menon v. The State of Bombay* to explain the meaning of "void" in **Article 13**.

*   The court distinguished between pre-Constitution and post-Constitution laws, noting that American precedents primarily concern post-Constitution laws that were "stillborn".

#### Provisions of Law:

*   **Article 13(1) of the Constitution:** States that "All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void".

*   **Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution:** Guarantees to all citizens "to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business".

*   **Article 19(6) of the Constitution (as amended by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951):** Allows the State to make laws imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by Article 19(1)(g) in the interest of the general public, including laws relating to the creation of State monopolies.

*   **Article 31(2) of the Constitution:** (Prior to the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955) Provided that "No property, movable or immovable, including any interest in, or in any company owning, any commercial or industrial undertaking, shall be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation, or specifies the principles on which, and the manner in which, the compensation is to be determined and given".

*   **Section 58 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939:** Governed the terms and renewal of permits for motor vehicles. The original language specified that "A permit other than a temporary permit issued under Section 62 shall be effective without renewal for such period, not less than three years and not more than five years, as the Regional Transport Authority may in its discretion specify in the permit".

*   **C. P. & Berar Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1947:** Amended the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, granting the government powers to control and regulate road transport. This included replacing item (ii) of sub-Section (1) of Section 43 of the Central Act with provisions to "fix maximum, minimum or specified fares or freights for stage carriages and public carriers" and to "cancel any permit granted under the Act".

## Decision:

*   The court dismissed the petitions, affirming that the **C. P. & Berar Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1947**, was valid and enforceable.

*   The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, and the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, removed the inconsistencies between the impugned Act and the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

*   The state's notification declaring its intention to take over bus routes was deemed constitutional.
