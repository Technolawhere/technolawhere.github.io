# Delhi's Air Pollution Problem
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
<p>In J. R. R. Tolkien’s book, The Hobbit, Smaug the terrible, the last of the great dragons of middle earth, on getting to know about the enormous treasure hoard of the Dwarven kingdom of Erebor, flew down from the mountains in the north, attacked and laid to waste both the kingdom and the neighbouring town of Dale. The surrounding domain became a scarred wasteland known to the Dwarves and Men as the “Desolation of Smaug”. The wicked Dragon ruled over these treasures of the Lonely Mountain for about 2 centuries before it was killed by the bold efforts of a company of dwarves and Bard, the bowman.</p>

<p>Many thousands of years later, the dragon, Smog the terrible, has taken birth again. It flies down from the rice growing plains of the north and plunders the lands of Delhi. It rules these lands uncontested. It is particularly attracted by the treasures of ’Dhanteras’ and wreaks havoc on the night of Diwali which becomes the night of Desolation of Smog.  It leaves and reappears at its own will throughout the year. The surrounding areas of Delhi: the NCR, have become a deeply scared wasteland due to its unending tyranny. Delhi is yet to see a successful attempt of some brave company of Dwarves and Men that will end this enslavement. </p>
