# Delhi's Air Pollution Problem
In J. R. R. Tolkien’s book, The Hobbit, Smaug the terrible, the last of the great dragons of middle earth, on getting to know about the enormous treasure hoard of the Dwarven kingdom of Erebor, flew down from the mountains in the north, attacked and laid to waste both the kingdom and the neighbouring town of Dale. The surrounding domain became a scarred wasteland known to the Dwarves and Men as the “Desolation of Smaug”. The wicked Dragon ruled over these treasures of the Lonely Mountain for about 2 centuries before it was killed by the bold efforts of a company of dwarves and Bard, the bowman.

Many thousands of years later, the dragon, Smog the terrible, has taken birth again. It flies down from the rice growing plains of the north and plunders the lands of Delhi. It rules these lands uncontested. It is particularly attracted by the treasures of ’Dhanteras’ and wreaks havoc on the night of Diwali which becomes the night of Desolation of Smog.  It leaves and reappears at its own will throughout the year. The surrounding areas of Delhi: the NCR, have become a deeply scared wasteland due to its unending tyranny. Delhi is yet to see a successful attempt of some brave company of Dwarves and Men that will end this enslavement. 

![Smog the tyrannical returns!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/Sketches/Smog%20has%20returned.png "Smog the terrible!")

This post is an attempt at understanding Smog the tyrannical, with the hopes that a deeper understanding will be able to better guide those who are brave enough to stand against it.

## How bad really is Delhi's Air?

Take a look at the following tables compiled by me:

![Pollutant Levels Over the Years and Average Values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/Table-%20Pollution%20Levels%20Over%20the%20Years%20and%20Average%20Values.jpg "Pollutant Levels Over the Years and Average Values")

Above data has been extracted from CPCB Annual Air Quality Monitoring Programme Reports. It must be noted here that 2020 saw country-wide lockdowns due to COVID-19 outbreak. Industrial as well as vehicular activity was virtually reduced to non-existent levels during these times. Yet, even if we are to remove the 2020 data while calculating annual averages for various pollutants, it doesn’t make much difference. This indicates that there are multiple contributing factors to the pollution problem and vehicular and industrial factors contribute lesser than usually assumed. Pollution sources, as I will show later, vary with the time of the year, sometimes contributing more and sometimes less to the pie.

![Extent of Overshoot Above the Maximum Prescribed Limits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/Table-%20Extent%20of%20Overshoot%20Above%20the%20Maximum%20Prescribed%20Limits.jpg "Extent of Overshoot Above the Maximum Prescribed Limits")

Comparing the annual averages calculated from CPCB data against the prescribed maximum levels under National Ambient Air Quality Standards notified by CPCB under Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, reveals an alarming situation with respect to PM10 and PM2.5 pollutants in particular. An important observation is the difference in what the WHO and the Indian authorities consider as clean air. What is safe to breathe in long term to the Indian authorities is 538% over the safe levels for NO2, 1377% over the safe levels for PM10 and 2046% over the safe levels for PM2.5, for the WHO under its Air Quality Guidelines of 2021. When the situation is compared against such international standards, it becomes extremely unnerving. An obvious question that arises after seeing this difference is why is there a difference of standards at all? Wouldn't toxic air be toxic to all human beings irrespective of where they stay? By having lower standards for measuring toxicity, are we devaluing talented Indian lives? These questions will be discussed in another writeup that I will hyperlink HERE.

![Month-wise Daily Avg. AQI for Delhi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/Table-%20Month-wise%20Daily%20Avg.%20AQI%20for%20Delhi.jpg "Month-wise Daily Avg. AQI for Delhi")
![Comparative AQI Category Status for Delhi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/Table-%20Comparative%20AQI%20Category%20Status%20for%20Delhi.jpg "Comparative AQI Category Status for Delhi")

Takeaway from the above two tables is that the average AQI of Delhi during the summer and winter months, is between poor to very poor with some respite during the 3-month period of monsoon when the air is borderline satisfactory. On an average, there are about 301 unfit air quality days in a year. It should be noted here that I have included moderate quality air in the unfit air category, in my analysis, as according to CPCB, when the AQI [(check here)](https://airquality.cpcb.gov.in/AQI_India/) is in moderate category, it may cause 


"Breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases" 


So, including it in breathable/ fit category would not be correct.  


The tables above prove beyond doubt that the air pollution problem is a severe, year-round problem in Delhi that has various contributing factors and can pose serious health risks. To treat this problem, just like a physician would get diagnostic tests done, let us get some scans of the air to understand what exactly plagues Delhi's atmosphere and what is the reason behind it. But before that, let me introduce you to "The Usual Suspects".

![The Ususal Suspects](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/Sketches/The%20Ususal%20Suspects.jpeg "Our usual suspects, but are they all?")

## Know the Pollutants

Air pollutants may be classified in multiple ways, as shown in the diagram below:
 
![Air-pollutant-classification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/Air-pollutant-classification.png "Classification of air pollutants")

The following table summarizes the sources and ill effects of various air pollutants:

![Air Pollutants: Sources and Effect on Health](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/Table-Air%20Pollutants-Sources_and_Effect_on_Health.jpg "Air Pollutants: Sources and Effect on Health")

Note that under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, limits only on levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, PM10, PM2.5, ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, ammonia, benzene, benzo[a]pyrene, arsenic and nickel (12 pollutants in all) have been set. 
 
While doing my research on this matter, I came across an IITK report titled "Comprehensive Study on Air Pollution and Green House Gases (GHGs) in Delhi (Final Report: Air Pollution component)" which I found to be extremely well illustrated with in-depth study of various pollutants, their spatial distributions and their main sources. I have used this report while discussing each of the following pollutants commonly found in the city's air. Note that this study is based on winter of 2013-2014 and summer of 2014. 

### Particulate matter

Out of the pollutants seen earlier, the PM particles, as seen from the tables in the first section, pose a serious problem in the NCR region with levels being as high as 1400% and 2046% over WHO guidelines for PM10 and PM2.5 respectively. These PM particles carry certain signatures that are etched onto them at source. This property can be used to pinpoint their most probable sources. For example, PM particles having crustal signatures mainly consisting of silicon, aluminum, iron and calcium indicate their source to be soil/road/construction dust and fly ash. Presence of potassium in the particulate matter suggests its possible origin in the burning of biomass. Chlorine is an indicator of particulate matter originating from municipal waste. It was found in this study that PM10 and PM2.5 levels vary over different seasons along with their sources. 

#### PM2.5

The following graph shows the major contributing factors of the PM2.5 for the city of Delhi:

![PM2.5 Emission Load of Different Sources in the City Of Delhi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/PM2.5/PM2.5%20Emission%20Load%20of%20Different%20Sources%20in%20the%20City%20Of%20Delhi.jpg "PM2.5 Emission Load of Different Sources in the City Of Delhi")

A surprising fact that emerges from the above pie chart is that it is neither the vehicles nor the crops that are to take the main blame for most deadly form of pollution. It's road dust. 38% of all the PM2.5 contamination in Delhi's atmosphere is due to road dust. Following it are the numerous vehicles that spew their exhaust all around the city's settlement areas. Vehicular emissions have been dealt with, later below, by way of pie charts. Domestic sources like fuel used for cooking, heating and Industrial stacks around Delhi contribute almost equally to the PM2.5 emissions (about 11-12%). DG sets contribute about 6% to the problem.

![PM2.5 Elements seasonal comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/PM2.5/PM2.5%20Elements%20seasonal%20comparison-corrected.jpg "Seasonal comparison of Elements in PM2.5")

Note how in the last column of the above graph ("Overall") the Si and Ca content in the PM2.5 composition greatly increases during the summer months indicating widespread dust and resuspended fly ash enveloping Delhi. Weather conditions during these times are such that top soil and fly ash ponds are nearly bone-dry. Prevailing high speed winds make the particles airborne. 

![City level source contribution to ambient air PM2.5 levels: Winter vs Summer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/PM2.5/PM2.5%20summer%20versus%20winter.jpg "City level source contribution to ambient air PM2.5 levels: Winter vs Summer")

Seasonal variations, as talked about earlier, have been shown in the graph above. It was deduced from the preceding bar graph that the contribution of dust towards pollution greatly increased during summer months. The same can be seen in the above pie chart. Whereas the road dust contributed about 28% to the PM2.5 problem in summers (when the land and soil is dry and the prevailing winds are strong), its contribution fell to about 4% during the winter months when there is an inversion of air and the atmosphere is relatively still and stagnant.  Same is the case with fly ash that is dislodged from ash ponds, which are relatively dry during the summer months. Study attributes the whitish to greyish appearance of the atmosphere during these months to the high amount of dust particles in the atmosphere. Biomass burning (mainly crop burning) contributes a major chunk to the pie during winters but its contribution is reduced to more than half during the summers. Vehicular emissions contribute more during the winters probably because they are not dispersed due to the absence of winds and keep accumulating over the city. Secondary particles also see a jump in contribution during winters due to the stagnant atmosphere that’s already polluted with primary pollutants which are finding it tough to disperse. These primary pollutants undergo reactions during the day to form the yellowish-grey photochemical smog that covers the city.

Spatial distribution of PM2.5 alongside the land-use pattern map of Delhi has been shown below:

![Spatial Distribution of PM2.5 Emissions and Superimposition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/PM2.5/pm2.5%20map%20comparison.jpg "Spatial Distribution of PM2.5 Emissions and Superimposition Over Land-use Map of Delhi")

As can be seen from the map, PM2.5 emissions are hanging mostly over the settlement areas of the city. These particles have been known to cause maximum damage to the lungs as they can penetrate deep inside it and can also cross over to the bloodstream. This map goes on to show the dire need to address this PM problem as soon as possible lest it causes a long-term damage to the social capital of Delhi. 

#### PM10

The following graph shows the major contributing factors of PM10 pollution in the city of Delhi:

![PM10 Emission Load of Different Sources in the City of Delhi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/PM10/PM10%20Emission%20Load%20of%20Different%20Sources%20in%20the%20City%20Of%20Delhi.jpg "PM10 Emission Load of Different Sources in the City of Delhi")

Differences in seasonal contributions of different sources towards the PM10 problem for the six stations at which the study was conducted has been shown below. Note how there is a marked spike in coal and fly ash combined with soil and road dust during the summer months. A similar spike in vehicular emissions, secondary sulfate and secondary nitrate is seen during the winter months and the reason is the same as has been discussed in the preceding section.

![PM10: % Overall Source contribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/PM10/Overall%20PM10%20Contribution.jpg "PM10: % Overall Source contribution")


![Spatial Distribution of PM10 Emissions and Superimposition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/PM10/pm10%20map%20comparison.jpg "Spatial Distribution of PM10 Emissions and Superimposition Over Land-use Map of Delhi")

The above maps show that the PM10 pollution is significantly higher in certain pockets of Delhi near north Delhi particularly near Bhalswa garbage dump and Dilshad Garden area. Air pollution is a persistent problem around the landfill sites of Bhalswa, Ghazipur and Okhla. Surrounding areas have to often put with the smell of burning plastics among various other things. The garbage here continues to burn by itself due to high temperatures during the summer months which ignites the underneath trapped methane. Some of these landfills have remained ablaze for weeks in the past before the authorities managed to put them out only to re-ignite again and resume their spuing of toxic dioxins into the air. I vividly remember how we had a joke back in college about sticking out a thumb against the backdrop of the Bhalswa garbage dump to check whether we are out of its ”fall-out” range. 

![Bhalswa Fallout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/Sketches/bhalswa%20fallout%20com.jpeg "The character on the right is Vault Boy who is often seen posing as if giving a thumbs-up. Some say that he is actually measuring the size of an atomic cloud to estimate if he's safe or not. This is because during the cold war, people were told that if they saw a mushroom cloud on the horizon, they could tell whether they were going to die or not by comparing the cloud size against their thumb.")

Polluting the air is only one part of the problem with these landfills. Their leachate pollutes the soil and the ground water of the surrounding regions. Toxins are bioaccumulated and biomagnified around these landfills. But all this is perhaps a discussion matter for another post. If I do get around writing about it, it will be linked to HERE.

### NOx 

NOx is a shorthand for nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which are the most relevant nitrogen oxides for air pollution. These gases contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain, as well as affecting tropospheric ozone. NOx gases are usually produced from the reaction between nitrogen and oxygen during combustion of fuels, such as hydrocarbons, in air; especially at high temperatures, such as in car engines. In areas of high motor vehicle traffic, such as in large cities, the nitrogen oxides emitted can be a significant source of air pollution. NOx gases are also produced naturally by lightning. The following graph shows the major contributing sources of NOx pollution in the city.

![NOx Emission Load of Different Sources in the City of Delhi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/NOx/NOx%20Emission%20Load%20of%20Different%20Sources%20in%20the%20City%20Of%20Delhi.jpg "NOx Emission Load of Different Sources in the City of Delhi")

As generally observed elsewhere in the world, in Delhi too, the major sources of NOx are vehicles and industry exhausts.  One common solution that’s generally given to the NOx problem is the use of catalytic converters which can convert NOx back to nitrogen and water.

Spatial distribution of NOx emissions is shown below beside the land use map of Delhi. 

![Spatial Distribution of NOx Emissions and Superimposition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/NOx/NOx%20map%20comparison.jpg "Spatial Distribution of NOx Emissions and Superimposition")

It can be seen that the NOx emissions seem to be concentrated around major roads and congested areas of the city. One can see the GT Karnal Road forming in the north, Delhi - Jaipur Expressway connecting the city to Gurgaon forming in the south and connecting roads to Noida forming in the east on the NOx spatial distribution map. Use the superimposed image of the two maps for better visualisation. It can be seen that NOx are found in significant concentrations over the airport as well. The superimposed map also shows CP area to also have noticeable NOx concentrations. There are three deep blue spots prominently visible on the map: one in the north, one in the east and one in the south-east, near the border. These are Bawana industrial area, Pragati Powerplant and Badarpur Powerplant respectively.

### SO2

Major contributing sources of SO2 emissions are shown below.

![SO2 Emission Load of Different Sources in the City of Delhi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/SO2/SO2%20Emission%20Load%20of%20Different%20Sources%20in%20the%20City%20Of%20Delhi.jpg "SO2 Emission Load of Different Sources in the City of Delhi")

Industrial Stack contributes about 91% of the total SO2 emissions. Industrial stack is basically a chimney that emits industrial exhaust high up in the atmosphere. Stack heights of less than 20m are considered as industrial stacks in the study and stacks higher than that have been included under point sources. 
 
Below are the SO2 spatial emission and land-use map of Delhi for ready reference. Here too, the dark green hotspots in the east and in the south-east roughly correspond to the two Power stations mentioned above. Another hotspot is forming over the airport region and another over Wazirpur industrial area.

![Spatial Distribution of SO2 Emissions and Superimposition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/SO2/SO2%20map%20comparison.jpg "Spatial Distribution of SO2 Emissions and Superimposition")

### CO
The actual problem for which the vehicles are solely to blame is perhaps the CO emissions in the city. Apart from the vehicles, domestic emissions also contribute a significant chunk to the pie as seen in the chart below.

![CO Emission Load of Different Sources in the City of Delhi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/CO/CO_Emission_Load_of_Different_Sources_in_the_City_Of_Delhi.jpg "CO Emission Load of Different Sources in the City of Delhi")

In the spatial distribution of emissions map of CO, a similar pattern that was noticed in the NOx emissions map can be seen. I have placed them together below for ready reference.

![Spatial distribution of CO vs NOx Emissions in the city](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/CO/Spatial_Distribution_of_CO.jpg "Spatial distribution of CO vs NOx Emissions in the city")

### Vehicular emissions

With odd - even restrictions on vehicles in place after Diwali of 2023, it would be interesting to see how the vehicles contribute towards the pie of various pollutants and what kind of vehicles are to be blamed exactly for different types of pollutants. Below are some graphs that too have been picked from the IITK Report.

| ![CO Emission Load contribution of each vehicle type in city of Delhi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/CO/co_contribution_of_vehicles.jpg "CO Emission Load contribution of each vehicle type in city of Delhi") | ![NOx Emission Load contribution of each vehicle type in city of Delhi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/NOx/NOx%20contribution%20of%20vehicles.jpg "NOx Emission Load contribution of each vehicle type in city of Delhi") |
|---------|---------|
| ![SOx Emission Load contribution of each vehicle type in city of Delhi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/SO2/SO2%20contribution%20of%20vehicles.jpg "SOx Emission Load contribution of each vehicle type in city of Delhi") | ![PM2.5 Emission Load contribution of each vehicle type in city of Delhi](https://github.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/blob/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/PM2.5/PM2.5%20contribution%20of%20vehicles.jpg?raw=true "PM2.5 Emission Load contribution of each vehicle type in city of Delhi")
|![PM10 Emission Load contribution of each vehicle type in city of Delhi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technolawhere/technolawhere.github.io/main/images/DelhiAirPollution/PM10/PM10%20contribution%20of%20vehicles.jpg "PM10 Emission Load contribution of each vehicle type in city of Delhi")

A surprising observation amongst all this data is the fact that 2 wheelers contribute significantly to the severe PM problem of Delhi along with trucks. 4 wheelers contribute just about 10% as against the massive 80% contribution of the trucks and 2 wheelers together (46% and 33% respectively). This data is significant in deciding how the odd even scheme should be implemented. In the past, two wheelers have been exempted from the odd-even scheme. Data in hand shows that such a policy-step may be ineffective. In order to reduce PM emissions, 2 wheelers have to necessarily be included within restrictions. 
 
## Control Options and Action Plan 

Based on the above study of emission sources and how they impact the pollutant concentrations, the following control options may be implemented:
1.	Provision of LPG to all in the city.
2.	Stopping of municipal solid waste burning by improving garbage collection and disposal facilities. Legacy waste should be considered for use in waste to energy plants in other regions at appropriate times. 
3.	With regard to construction and demolition works, use of fine screens to vertically cover the areas is recommended. Raw material should be covered properly to prevent being blown away. Wind breakers and water sprays should be used at the sites. It is also recommended that while transporting raw materials in trucks, it should be fully covered. 
4.	For road dust, vacuum sweeping of roads four times a month coupled with carpeting of shoulders and mechanical sweeping with water wash may improve the AQ by about 70%, claims the study. For soil dust, green cover for barren areas is a necessity.
5.	Use of coal should be stopped in over 9000 hotels and restaurants present in the city. This, the study claims, will lead to about 80% improvement in the general AQ of the city if implemented properly over the next few years.
6.	For vehicles, engine as well as fuel upgrades are recommended by the report. Implementation of BS6 for all diesel vehicles, ultra-low sulphur fuel which is BS6 complaint, two wheelers with Multi Point Fuel Injection System or equivalent, electric vehicles composing 2% of all 2 wheelers, 10% of all 3 wheelers and 2% of all 4 wheelers with charging facilities in new residential and commercial buildings may help in reducing the AQI readings significantly in the long run. Mandatory maintenance and inspection of all vehicles should also be strictly implemented.
7.	To control pollution from industry and DG sets, its recommended to reduce sulphur content in the industrial fuel and to ensure uninterrupted power supply in the NCR region. Small DG sets of capacity 2KVA or less should be banned in the city.
8.	There are 13 thermal power plants with capacity over 11000MW within the radius of 300Km of Delhi. De-SOx-ing and De-NOx-ing of all these power-pants is recommended. 
9.	With respect to pollution caused by stubble burning locally and in the neighbouring states, potential alternatives like energy production, biogas generation, commercial feedstock for cattle, composting, conversion in biochar, raw material for industry are recommended. 

Even with all these measures, the study is sceptical of achieving AQI ranges within the set national limits. This is because implementation within the Delhi region alone is not sufficient to improve the air quality in the city. Delhi is a part of a larger contiguous area whose weather and atmospheric conditions are closely interlinked. Activities in one place have a direct effect on others. The study recommends extension of this plan to the entire NCR region as a second phase plan to see long term benefits.

All in all, by way of this write-up, I have tried to develop an understanding as to what exactly is the problem that Delhi is facing throughout the year by using some authentic sources that are available in the public domain. This diagnosis is naturally the first step in treating this disease or, as I started out by saying, tackling smog the tyrannical. Equipped with such an understanding, our brave company of dwarves and men may be able to mount an attack! The need of the hour is to begin acting immediately on whatever data is available instead of first waiting for the situation to get bad. A year-round problem requires a year-round coordination between different stakeholders and action. The inertia of the government machinery is too great to spring into action at the last moment. Often, that results in too little being done, too late. Countless young and innocent children and elderly struggle for each breath in the very capital of the country that secures right to life as a basic fundament right to all. All the laxity on the part of the administration until the situation goes out of control with the Hon'ble Supreme Court then jumping in and sounding the alarm for the administration to begin their desperate attempt of handling the fast-worsening catastrophe reminds me of Sant Kabir Ji's words:

दुःख में सुमिरन सब करे, सुख में करे न कोय।

जो सुख में सुमिरन करे, तो दुःख काहे को होय।
 
Duhkh mein sumiran sab kare, sukh mein kare na koy.

Jo sukh mein sumiran kare, to duhkh kaahe ko hoy.
 
To address this problem effectively our administration will have to sumiran about it not just during bad days but on the clear and breathable days as well. If it is not done, Smaug will continue to return as and when it wishes and its rule over the realm of men will never end.
