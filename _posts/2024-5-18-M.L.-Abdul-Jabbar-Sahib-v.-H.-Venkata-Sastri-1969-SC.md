# M.L. Abdul Jabbar Sahib v. H. Venkata Sastri, AIR 1969 SC 1147 : (1969) 1 SCC 573

JUDGE: BACHAWAT

## Issue

This case deals with, among other things, the necessity of concept of **Animo Attestandi** or animus to attest or the intent to attest w.r.t. a valid attestation under TPA, 1882. 

## Observations of the Court

* Certain observations made in **Veerappa Chettiar v. Subramania lyyar (AIR 1929 Mad. 1)** were recalled:
   
   * Signatures of the registering officer and the identifying witnesses
endorsed on a mortgage document can be treated as those of attesting witnesses as if:

      * The signatories are those who have seen the execution or received a personal acknowledgment from the executant of his having executed the document
    
      * They sign their names in the presence of the executant
    
      * While so doing they had the aninus to attest
    
* **Jarman** on Wills has said "In every case the Court must be satisfied that the names were written animo attestandi"

* In **Girja Datt v. Gangotri (AIR 1955 SC 346)** it was held that persons who had **identified the testator** at the time of the registration of the will and had appended their signatures at the foot of the endorsement by the sub-Registrar, were not attesting witnesses as their signatures were not put “animo attestandi”.

* In **Abinash Chandra Bidvanidhi Bhattacharya v. Dasarath Malo (AIR 1929 Cal 123)** court held that a person who had put his name under the word **“scribe”** was not an attesting witness as he had put his signature only for the purpose of authenticating that he was a “scribe”.

* In **Shiam Sunder Singh v. Jagannath Singh (AIR 1927 PC 248)** Privy Council held that legatees who had put their signatures on the will in **token of their consent** to its execution were not attesting witnesses and were not disqualified from taking as legatees.

* Further the court said that the **signature of the registering officer** under Indian Registration Act, 1908, is prima facie a discharge of the duty assigned to him under S.59 of that act and not for the purpose of attesting it or certifying that he has received from the executant personal acknowledgement of his signature.
