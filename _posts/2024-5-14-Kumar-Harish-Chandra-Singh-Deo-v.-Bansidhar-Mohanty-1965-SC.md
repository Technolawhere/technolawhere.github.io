# Kumar Harish Chandra Singh Deo v. Bansidhar Mohanty, AIR 1965 SC 1738 : (1966) 1 SCR 153

JUDGE: J.R. MUDHOLKAR

## Facts

* Parties involved in this case were the mortgagor, the mortgagee and a money lender who had advanced money to the mortgagor and who was also one of the attesting witnesses.

## Issues

* Whether the money lender, who was a party to the whole transaction but not a party to the mortgage deed itself can be an attesting witness?

## Relevant Sections

* Section 59 of the Transfer of Property Act, which, amongst other things, provides that a mortgage deed shall be attested by at least two witnesses does not in terms debar the lender of money from attesting the deed.

## Observations of the Court and Decision

* According to the Court, the object of attestation was to protect the executant from executing the deed under force, fraud or undue influence. As the law requires examination of at least one attesting witness even after hearing the testimony of the parties to the deed, by inference, therefore, parties to a deed cannot act as attesting witnesses.

* In **Peary Mohan Maiti v. Sreenath Chandra** 14 Cal WN 1046; **Sarur Jigar Begum v. Barado Kanta** ILR 37 Cal 525 and **Gomathi Ammal v. V.S.M. Krishna Iyer** AIR 1954 Mad 126, similar conclusion that a party to a document which is required by law to be attested is not competent to attest the document was reached.

* But any person, who is not a party to the deed, can be an attesting witness, even if she is someone who is interested in the entire transaction.

* Thus, the court drew a distinction between a person who is a party to the deed and a person who is a party to the transaction. There is no restriction on a person who is not a party to the deed but a party to the transaction to act as an attesting witness. (Note: Similar distinction was drawn in **Balu Ravii Gharat v. Gopal Gangadhar Dhabu** 12 Ind Cas 531 (Bom) and **Durga Din. v. Suraj Bakhsh** AIR 1931 Oudh 285 and was upheld by the Court)

* DECISION: Money lender, being a party to the transaction and not a party to the deed was competent to be an attesting witness.
