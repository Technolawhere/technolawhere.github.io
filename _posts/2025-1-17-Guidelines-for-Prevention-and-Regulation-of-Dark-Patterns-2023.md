These guidelines basically set a framework for dealing with dark patterns legally, ensuring that consumers are protected from such misleading tactics that are often used manipulate them. 

## What the Dark Patters?

The guidelines define dark patterns under section 2(e) as:

> “dark patterns” shall mean any practices or deceptive design pattern using user interface or user experience interactions on any platform that is designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do, by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice, amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights 

Essentially, they refer to certain design techniques or user interface strategies that are intentionally misleading or deceptive. The goal of these techniques is to manipulate users into taking actions that they didn’t originally intend or want to do. These actions could be anything from making an accidental purchase, subscribing to a service they didn’t mean to, or giving away personal information.

Dark patterns work by influencing the way choices are presented to users, often taking advantage of human psychology to nudge them in a certain direction without their full awareness or consent. For example, a website might make the "cancel subscription" button harder to find or try to trick users into opting into email newsletters.

## Different Kinds of Dark Patterns

There are 13 kinds of dark patterns that are specified under annexure 1 to the guidelines:

1. **False Urgency:** means falsely stating or implying the sense of urgency or scarcity so as to mislead a user into making an immediate purchase or taking an immediate action, which may lead to a purchase. This would include:
   
   a. Showing false popularity of a product or service to manipulate user decision
   
   b. Stating that quantities of a particular product or service are more limited than they actually are.

   The following illustrations are provided in the annexure wrt this:

      a. Presenting false data on high demand without appropriate context. For instance, “Only 2 rooms left! 30 others are looking at this right now”.

      b. Falsely creating time-bound pressure to make a purchase, such as describing a sale as an ‘exclusive’ sale for a limited time only for a select group of users.  


2. **Basket sneaking:**
