These guidelines basically set a framework for dealing with dark patterns legally, ensuring that consumers are protected from such misleading tactics that are often used manipulate them. 

## What the Dark Patters?

The guidelines define dark patterns under section 2(e) as:

> “dark patterns” shall mean any practices or deceptive design pattern using user interface or user experience interactions on any platform that is designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do, by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice, amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights 

Essentially, they refer to certain design techniques or user interface strategies that are intentionally misleading or deceptive. The goal of these techniques is to manipulate users into taking actions that they didn’t originally intend or want to do. These actions could be anything from making an accidental purchase, subscribing to a service they didn’t mean to, or giving away personal information.

Dark patterns work by influencing the way choices are presented to users, often taking advantage of human psychology to nudge them in a certain direction without their full awareness or consent. For example, a website might make the "cancel subscription" button harder to find or try to trick users into opting into email newsletters.

## Different Kinds of Dark Patterns

There are 13 kinds of dark patterns that are specified under annexure 1 to the guidelines:

1. **False Urgency:** means falsely stating or implying the sense of urgency or scarcity so as to mislead a user into making an immediate purchase or taking an immediate action, which may lead to a purchase. This would include:
   
   a. Showing false popularity of a product or service to manipulate user decision
   
   b. Stating that quantities of a particular product or service are more limited than they actually are.

   The following illustrations are provided in the annexure wrt this:

      a. Presenting false data on high demand without appropriate context. For instance, “Only 2 rooms left! 30 others are looking at this right now”.

      b. Falsely creating time-bound pressure to make a purchase, such as describing a sale as an ‘exclusive’ sale for a limited time only for a select group of users.  


2. **Basket sneaking:** means inclusion of additional items such as products, services, payments to charity or donation at the time of checkout from a platform, without the consent of the user, such that the total amount payable by the user is more than the amount payable for the product or service chosen by the user:

   Provided that the addition of free samples or providing complimentary services or addition of necessary fees 
disclosed at the time of purchase, shall not be considered as basket sneaking.

   Explanation- The term “necessary fees” means, the fees which is necessary to fulfill the completion of the 
order such as delivery charges, gift wrapping, additional taxes on the product charged by the government or 
any other charges which are explicitly disclosed to the consumer at the time of purchase. 

   Illustrations: 

      (a) automatic addition of paid ancillary services with a pre-ticked box or otherwise to the cart when a consumer is purchasing a product or service; 

      (b) a user purchases a single salon service, but while checking out, a subscription to the salon service is automatically added; 

      (c) automatically adding travel insurance while a user purchases a flight ticket.

3. **Confirm shaming:** means using a phrase, video, audio or any other means to create a sense of fear or shame or ridicule or guilt in the mind of the user so as to nudge the user to act in a certain way that results in the user purchasing a product or service from the platform or continuing a subscription of a service, primarily for the purpose of making commercial gains by subverting consumer choice. 

    Illustrations:

   (a) a platform for booking flight tickets using the phrase “I will stay unsecured”, when a user does not include insurance in their cart;

   (b) a platform that adds a charity in the basket without user’s consent and uses a phrase such as “charity is for rich, I don’t care” when a user prefers to opt out of contributing towards charity.


4. **Forced action:** mean forcing a user into taking an action that would require the user to buy any additional goods or subscribe or sign up for an unrelated service or share personal information in order to buy or subscribe to the product or service originally intended by the user.

   Illustrations:

   a. prohibiting a user from continuing with the use of product or service for the consideration originally paid and contracted for, unless they upgrade for a higher rate or fees;

   b. forcing a user to subscribe to a newsletter in order to purchase a product;

   c. forcing a user to download an unintended or unrelated separate app to access a service originally advertised on another app e.g. A user downloads app, X, meant for listing houses for renting. Once the user downloads X, they are forced to download another app, Y, for hiring a painter. Without downloading Y, the user is unable to access any services on X;

   d. forcing a user to share personal information linked with Aadhar or credit card, even when such details are not necessary for making the intended purchase;

   e. forcing a user to share details of his contacts or social networks in order to access products or services purchased or intended to be purchased by the user;

   d. Making it difficult for consumers to understand and alter their privacy settings, thereby encouraging them to give more personal information than they mean to while making the intended purchase.

5. **Subscription trap:** means the process of- 

    (i)  making cancellation of a paid subscription impossible or a complex and lengthy process; or 

    (ii) hiding the cancellation option for a subscription; or

    (iii) forcing a user to provide payment details or authorization for auto debits for availing a free subscription; or 

    (iv) making the instructions related to cancellation of subscription ambiguous, latent, confusing, 
cumbersome.

6. **Interface interference:** means a design element that manipulates the user interface in ways that
  
   (a) highlights certain specific information; and

   (b) obscures other relevant information relative to the other information; to misdirect a user from taking an action as desired.

   Illustrations:

   a. designing a light colored option for selecting “No” in response to a pop-up asking a user if they wish to make a purchase or concealing the cancellation symbol in tiny font or changing the meaning of key symbols to mean the opposite;

   b. A ‘X’ icon on the top-right corner of a pop-up screen leading to opening-up of another advertisement rather than closing it;

   c. designing a virtually less prominent designing a light colored option for selecting “No” in response to a 
pop-up asking a user if they wish to make a purchase.
