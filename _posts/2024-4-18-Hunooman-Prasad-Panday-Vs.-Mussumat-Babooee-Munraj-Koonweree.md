# Hunooman Prasad Panday v. Mussumat Babooee Munraj Koonweree (1854-1857) 6 Mooreâ€™s IA 393 (PC) 36

Judge: Lord Justice Knight Bruce

## Facts:

In this case the obligations of guardians managing properties of infants and of lenders dealing with such guardians have been laid out by the court.

## Power and Duties of the Guardian w.r.t to the property of the infant:

* Has limited or qualified power
  
* Such power can only be exercised rightly in
  
   1. a case of need, or
      
   2. for the benefit of the estate.

* Has to act prudently while exercising the powers.
  
* Mere creation of a charge securing a proper debt cannot be viewed as improvident (thoughtless) management as money to be secured on any estate is likely to be obtained on easier terms than a loan which rests on mere personal security.

## Obligations of the lender or alienee: 

* Duty to act in a bonafide manner.
  
* The lender is bound to inquire into the necessities for the loan, and to satisfy himself as well as he can, with reference to the parties with whom he is dealing, that the Manager is acting in the particular instance for the benefit of the estate. However, the real existence of an alleged sufficient and reasonably credited necessity will not affect his case.
  
* Not bound to see whether the money obtained is actually being applied to the purpose for which it was obtained.
   
* Unless he is shown to have acted in a malafide manner, he will not be affected, though it be shown that, with better management, the estate might have been kept free from debt.

## Note: 

The actual pressure on the estate, the danger to be averted, or the benefit to be conferred upon it, is the thing to be regarded while taking decisions in such matters where alienation is involved.
